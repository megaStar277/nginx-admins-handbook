#### Directories and files

  > If you compile NGINX with default parameters all files and directories are available from `/usr/local/nginx` location.

For upstream NGINX packaging paths can be as follows (it depends on the type of system/distribution):

- `/etc/nginx` - is the default configuration root for the NGINX service
  * other locations: `/usr/local/etc/nginx`, `/usr/local/nginx/conf`

- `/etc/nginx/nginx.conf` - is the default configuration entry point used by the NGINX services, includes the top-level http block and all other configuration contexts and files
  * other locations: `/usr/local/etc/nginx/nginx.conf`, `/usr/local/nginx/conf/nginx.conf`

- `/usr/share/nginx` - is the default root directory for requests, contains `html` directory and basic static files
  * other locations: `html/` in root directory

- `/var/log/nginx` - is the default log (access and error log) location for NGINX
  * other locations: `logs/` in root directory

- `/var/cache/nginx` - is the default temporary files location for NGINX
  * other locations: `/var/lib/nginx`

- `/etc/nginx/conf` - contains custom/vhosts configuration files
  * other locations:  `/etc/nginx/conf.d`, `/etc/nginx/sites-enabled` (I can't stand this debian-like convention...)

- `/var/run/nginx` - contains information about NGINX process(es)
  * other locations: `/usr/local/nginx/logs`, `logs/` in root directory

See also [Installation and Compile-Time Options - Files and Permissions](https://www.nginx.com/resources/wiki/start/topics/tutorials/installoptions/#files-and-permissions).

#### Commands

  > **:bookmark: [Use reload option to change configurations on the fly - Base Rules - P2](RULES.md#beginner-use-reload-option-to-change-configurations-on-the-fly)**

- `nginx -h` - shows the help
- `nginx -v` - shows the NGINX version
- `nginx -V` - shows the extended information about NGINX: version, build parameters, and configuration arguments
- `nginx -t` - tests the NGINX configuration
- `nginx -c <filename>` - sets configuration file (default: `/etc/nginx/nginx.conf`)
- `nginx -p <directory>` - sets prefix path (default: `/etc/nginx/`)
- `nginx -T` - tests the NGINX configuration and prints the validated configuration on the screen
- `nginx -s <signal>` - sends a signal to the NGINX master process:
  - `stop` - discontinues the NGINX process immediately
  - `quit` - stops the NGINX process after it finishes processing
inflight requests
  - `reload` - reloads the configuration without stopping processes
  - `reopen` - instructs NGINX to reopen log files
- `nginx -g <directive>` - sets [global directives](https://nginx.org/en/docs/ngx_core_module.html) out of configuration file

Some useful snippets for management of the NGINX daemon:

- testing configuration:

  ```bash
  /usr/sbin/nginx -t -c /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
  /usr/sbin/nginx -t -q -g 'daemon on; master_process on;' # ; echo $?
  ```

- starting daemon:

  ```bash
  /usr/sbin/nginx -g 'daemon on; master_process on;'

  service nginx start
  systemctl start nginx

  /usr/local/etc/rc.d/nginx start

  # You can also start NGINX from start-stop-daemon script:
  /sbin/start-stop-daemon --quiet --start --exec /usr/sbin/nginx --background --retry QUIT/5 --pidfile /run/nginx.pid
  ```

- stopping daemon:

  ```bash
  /usr/sbin/nginx -s quit     # graceful shutdown (waiting for the worker processes to finish serving current requests)
  /usr/sbin/nginx -s stop     # fast shutdown (kill connections immediately)

  service nginx stop
  systemctl stop nginx

  /usr/local/etc/rc.d/nginx stop

  # You can also stop NGINX from start-stop-daemon script:
  /sbin/start-stop-daemon --quiet --stop --retry QUIT/5 --pidfile /run/nginx.pid
  ```

- reloading daemon:

  ```bash
  /usr/sbin/nginx -g 'daemon on; master_process on;' -s reload

  service nginx reload
  systemctl reload nginx

  kill -HUP $(cat /var/run/nginx.pid)
  kill -HUP $(pgrep -f "nginx: master")
  ```

- restarting daemon:

  ```bash
  service nginx restart
  systemctl restart nginx

  /usr/local/etc/rc.d/nginx restart
  ```

Something about testing configuration:

  > You cannot test half-baked configurations, for example, you defined a server section for your domain in a separate file. Any attempt to test such a file will throw errors. The file has to be complete in all respects.

#### Configuration syntax

  > **:bookmark: [Organising Nginx configuration - Base Rules - P2](RULES.md#beginner-organising-nginx-configuration)**<br>
  > **:bookmark: [Format, prettify and indent your Nginx code - Base Rules - P2](RULES.md#beginner-format-prettify-and-indent-your-nginx-code)**

NGINX uses a micro programming language in the configuration files. This language's design is heavily influenced by Perl and Bourne Shell. For me NGINX configuration has a simple and very transparent structure.

##### Comments

NGINX configuration files don't support comment blocks, they only accept `#` at the beginning of a line for a comment.

##### End of lines

Lines containing directives must end with a semicolon (`;`), otherwise NGINX will fail to load the configuration and report an error.

##### Variables, Strings, and Quotes

Variables start with `$`. Some modules introduce variables can be used when setting directives.

  > There are some directives that do not support variables, e.g. `access_log` or `error_log`.

To assign value to the variable you should use a `set` directive:

```nginx
set $var "value";
```

  > See [`if`, `break`, and `set`](#if-break-and-set) section to learn more about variables.

Some interesting things about variables:

  > Make sure to read the [agentzh's Nginx Tutorials](https://openresty.org/download/agentzh-nginx-tutorials-en.html) - it's about NGINX tips & tricks. This guy is a NGINX Guru and creator of the OpenResty. In these tutorials he describes, amongst other things, variables in great detail. I also recommend [nginx built-in variables](http://siwei.me/blog/posts/nginx-built-in-variables).

- the most variables in NGINX only exist at runtime, not during configuration time
- the scope of variables spreads out all over configuration
- variable assignment occurs when requests are actually being served
- variable have exactly the same lifetime as the corresponding request
- each request does have its own version of all those variables' containers (different containers values)
- requests do not interfere with each other even if they are referencing a variable with the same name
- the assignment operation is only performed in requests that access location

Strings may be inputted without quotes unless they include blank spaces, semicolons or curly braces, then they need to be escaped with backslashes or enclosed in single/double quotes.

Quotes are required for values which are containing space(s) and/or some other special characters, otherwise NGINX will not recognize them. You can either quote or `\`-escape some special characters like `" "` or `";"` in strings (characters that would make the meaning of a statement ambiguous). So the following instructions are the same:

```nginx
# 1)
add_header X-Header "nginx web server;";

# 2)
add_header X-Header nginx\ web\ server\;;
```

Variables in quoted strings are expanded normally unless the `$` is escaped.

##### Directives, Blocks, and Contexts

  > Read this great article about [the NGINX configuration inheritance model](https://blog.martinfjordvald.com/2012/08/understanding-the-nginx-configuration-inheritance-model/) by [Martin Fjordvald](https://blog.martinfjordvald.com/about/).

Configuration options are called directives. We have four types of directives:

- standard directive - one value per context:

  ```nginx
  worker_connections 512;
  ```

- array directive - multiple values per context:

  ```nginx
  error_log /var/log/nginx/localhost/localhost-error.log warn;
  ```

- action directive - something which does not just configure:

  ```nginx
  rewrite ^(.*)$ /msie/$1 break;
  ```

- `try_files` directive:

  ```nginx
  try_files $uri $uri/ /test/index.html;
  ```

Valid directives begin with a variable name and then state an argument or series of arguments separated by spaces.

Directives are organised into groups known as **blocks** or **contexts**. Generally, context is a block directive that can have other directives inside braces. It appears to be organised in a tree-like structure, defined by sets of brackets - `{` and `}`.

  > The curly braces actually denote a new configuration context.

As a general rule, if a directive is valid in multiple nested scopes, a declaration in a broader context will be passed on to any child contexts as default values. The children contexts can override these values at will.

  > Directives placed in the configuration file outside of any contexts are considered to be in the global/main context.

Directives can only be used in the contexts that they were designed for. NGINX will error out on reading a configuration file with directives that are declared in the wrong context.

  > If you want to review all directives see [alphabetical index of directives](https://nginx.org/en/docs/dirindex.html).

Contexts can be layered within one another (a level of inheritance). Their structure looks like this:

```
Global/Main Context
        |
        |
        +-----Â» Events Context
        |
        |
        +-----Â» HTTP Context
        |          |
        |          |
        |          +-----Â» Server Context
        |          |          |
        |          |          |
        |          |          +-----Â» Location Context
        |          |
        |          |
        |          +-----Â» Upstream Context
        |
        |
        +-----Â» Mail Context
```

The most important contexts are shown in the following description. These will be the ones that you will be dealing with for the most part:

- `global` - contains global configuration directives; is used to set the settings for NGINX globally and is the only context that is not surrounded by curly braces

- `events` - configuration for the events module; is used to set global options for connection processing; contains directives that affect connection processing are specified

- `http` - controls all the aspects of working with the HTTP module and holds directives for handling HTTP and HTTPS traffic; directives in this context can be grouped into:

  - HTTP client directives
  - HTTP file I/O directives
  - HTTP hash directives
  - HTTP socket directives

- `server` - defines virtual host settings and describes a logical separation of a set of resources associated with a particular domain or IP address

- `location` - define directives to handle client request and indicates a URI that comes either from the client or from an internal redirect

- `upstream` - define a pool of back-end servers that NGINX can proxy the request; commonly used for defining either a web server cluster for load balancing

NGINX also provides other contexts (e.g. used for mapping) such as:

- `map` - is used to set the value of a variable depending on the value of another variable. It provides a mapping of one variableâ€™s values to determine what the second variable should be set to

- `geo` - is used to specify a mapping. However, this mapping is specifically used to categorize client IP addresses. It sets the value of a variable depending on the connecting IP address

- `types` - is used to map MIME types to the file extensions that should be associated with them

- `if` - provide conditional processing of directives defined within, execute the instructions contained if a given test returns `true`

- `limit_except` - is used to restrict the use of certain HTTP methods within a location context

Look also at the graphic below. It presents the most important contexts with reference to the configuration:

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/trimstray/nginx-admins-handbook/blob/master/static/img/nginx_contexts.png" alt="nginx-contexts">
</p>

NGINX lookup starts from the http block, then through one or more server blocks, followed by the location block(s).

##### External files

`include` directive may appear inside any contexts to perform conditional inclusion. It attaching another file, or files matching the specified mask:

```nginx
include /etc/nginx/proxy.conf;

# or:
include /etc/nginx/conf/*.conf;
```

  > You cannot use variables in NGINX config file includes. This is because includes are processed before any variables are evaluated.

##### Measurement units

  > It is recommended to always specify a suffix for greater transparency.

Sizes can be specified in:

- without a suffix: Bytes
- `k` or `K`: Kilobytes
- `m` or `M`: Megabytes
- `g` or `G`: Gigabytes

```nginx
client_max_body_size 2m;
```

Time intervals can be specified in:

- without a suffix: Seconds
- `ms`: Milliseconds
- `s`: Seconds
- `m`: Minutes
- `h`: Hours
- `d`: Days
- `w`: Weeks
- `M`: Months (30 days)
- `y`: Years (365 days)

```nginx
proxy_read_timeout 20; # =20s, default
```

Some of the time intervals can be specified only with a seconds resolution. You should also remember about this:

  > _Multiple units can be combined in a single value by specifying them in the order from the most to the least significant, and optionally separated by whitespace. For example, `1h 30m` specifies the same time as `90m` or `5400s`_.

##### Regular expressions with PCRE

  > **:bookmark: [Enable PCRE JIT to speed up processing of regular expressions - Performance - P2](RULES.md#beginner-enable-pcre-jit-to-speed-up-processing-of-regular-expressions)**

Before start reading next chapters you should know what regular expressions are and how they works (they are not a black magic really). I recommend two great and short write-ups about regular expressions created by [Jonny Fox](https://medium.com/@jonny.fox):

- [Regex tutorialâ€Šâ€”â€ŠA quick cheatsheet by examples](https://medium.com/factory-mind/regex-tutorial-a-simple-cheatsheet-by-examples-649dc1c3f285)
- [Regex cookbookâ€Šâ€”â€ŠTop 10 Most wanted regex](https://medium.com/factory-mind/regex-cookbook-most-wanted-regex-aa721558c3c1)

Why? Regular expressions can be used in both the `server_name` and `location` (also in other) directives, and sometimes you must have a great skills of reading them. I think you should create the most readable regular expressions that do not become spaghetti code - impossible to debug and maintain.

NGINX uses the [PCRE](https://www.pcre.org/) library to perform complex manipulations with your `location` blocks and use the powerful `rewrite` directive. To use a regular expression for string matching, it first needs to be compiled, which is usually done at the configuration phase.

You can also enable `pcre_jit` to dynamic translation during execution (at run time) rather than prior to execution. This option can improve performance, however, in some cases `pcre_jit` may have a negative effect. So, before enabling it, I recommend you to read this great document: [PCRE Performance Project](https://zherczeg.github.io/sljit/pcre.html).

##### Enable syntax highlighting

###### vi/vim

```bash
# 1) Download vim plugin for NGINX:

# Official NGINX vim plugin:
mkdir -p ~/.vim/syntax/

wget "http://www.vim.org/scripts/download_script.php?src_id=19394" -O ~/.vim/syntax/nginx.vim

###### Sublime Text

Install `cabal` - system for building and packaging Haskell libraries and programs (on Ubuntu):

```bash
add-apt-repository -y ppa:hvr/ghc
apt-get update

apt-get install -y cabal-install-1.22 ghc-7.10.2

# Add this to the main configuration file of your shell:
export PATH=$HOME/.cabal/bin:/opt/cabal/1.22/bin:/opt/ghc/7.10.2/bin:$PATH
source $HOME/.<shellrc>

cabal update
```

- `nginx-lint`:

  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/temoto/nginx-lint

  cd nginx-lint && cabal install --global
  ```

- `sublime-nginx` + `SublimeLinter-contrib-nginx-lint`:

  Bring up the _Command Palette_ and type `install`. Among the commands you should see _Package Control: Install Package_. Type `nginx` to install [sublime-nginx](https://github.com/brandonwamboldt/sublime-nginx) and after that do the above again for install [SublimeLinter-contrib-nginx-lint](https://github.com/irvinlim/SublimeLinter-contrib-nginx-lint): type `SublimeLinter-contrib-nginx-lint`.

#### Processes

  > **:bookmark: [Adjust worker processes - Performance - P3](RULES.md#beginner-adjust-worker-processes)**<br>
  > **:bookmark: [Improve debugging by disable daemon, master process, and all workers except one - Debugging - P4](RULES.md#beginner-improve-debugging-by-disable-daemon-master-process-and-all-workers-except-one)**

NGINX has **one master process** and **one or more worker processes**. It has also cache loader and cache manager processes but only if you enable caching.

The main purposes of the master process is to read and evaluate configuration files, as well as maintain the worker processes (respawn when a worker dies), handle signals, notify workers, opens log files, and, of course binding to ports.

Master process should be started as root user, because this will allow NGINX to open sockets below 1024 (it needs to be able to listen on port 80 for HTTP and 443 for HTTPS).

  > To defines the number of worker processes you should set `worker_processes` directive.

The worker processes do the actual processing of requests and get commands from master process. They runs in an event loop (registering events and responding when one occurs), handle network connections, read and write content to disk, and communicate with upstream servers. These are spawned by the master process, and the user and group will as specified (unprivileged).

  > The worker processes spend most of the time just sleeping and waiting for new events (they are in `S` state in `top`).

The following signals can be sent to the NGINX master process:

| <b>SIGNAL</b> | <b>NUM</b> | <b>DESCRIPTION</b> |
| :---         | :---:        | :---         |
| `TERM`, `INT` | **15**, **2** | quick shutdown |
| `QUIT` | **3** | graceful shutdown |
| `KILL` | **9** | halts a stubborn process |
| `HUP` | **1** | configuration reload, start new workers, gracefully shutdown the old worker processes |
| `USR1` | **10** | reopen the log files |
| `USR2` | **12** | upgrade executable on the fly |
| `WINCH` | **28** | gracefully shutdown the worker processes |

Thereâ€™s no need to control the worker processes yourself. However, they support some signals too:

| <b>SIGNAL</b> | <b>NUM</b> | <b>DESCRIPTION</b> |
| :---         | :---:        | :---         |
| `TERM`, `INT` | **15**, **2** | quick shutdown |
| `QUIT` | **3** | graceful shutdown |
| `USR1` | **10** | reopen the log files |

###### CPU pinning

Moreover, it is important to mention about `worker_cpu_affinity` directive (it's only supported on GNU/Linux). CPU affinity is used to control which CPUs NGINX utilizes for individual worker processes. By default, worker processes are not bound to any specific CPUs. What's more, system might schedule all worker processes to run on the same CPU which may not be efficient enough.

CPU affinity is represented as a bitmask (given in hexadecimal), with the lowest order bit corresponding to the first logical CPU and the highest order bit corresponding to the last logical CPU.

[Here](https://www.kutukupret.com/2010/11/18/nginx-worker_cpu_affinity/) you will find an amazing explanation of this. There is a [worker_cpu_affinity configuration generator](https://github.com/cubicdaiya/nwcagen) for NGINX. After all, I would recommend to let the OS scheduler to do the work.

###### Shutdown of worker processes

This directive should come in useful if you want to tweak NGINXâ€™s shutdown process, particularly if other servers or load balancers are relying upon predictable restart times or if it takes a long time to close worker processes.

The `worker_shutdown_timeout` directive configures a timeout to be used when gracefully shutting down worker processes.  When the timer expires, NGINX will try to close all the connections currently open to facilitate shutdown.

NGINXâ€™s [Maxim Dounin](https://twitter.com/mdounin) explains:

  > _The `worker_shutdown_timeout` directive is not expected to delay shutdown if there are no active connections. It was introduced to limit possible time spent in shutdown, that is, to ensure fast enough shutdown even if there are active connections._

When a worker process enters the "exiting" state, it does a few things:

  - mark itself as an exiting process
  - set a shutdown timer, if `worker_shutdown_timeout` is defined
  - close listening sockets
  - close idle connections

Then, if the shutdown timer was set, after the `worker_shutdown_timeout` interval, all connections are closed.

  > By default, NGINX to wait for and process additional data from a client before fully closing a connection, but only if heuristics suggests that a client may be sending more data.

Sometimes, you can see `nginx: worker process is shutting down` in your log file. The problem occurs when reloading the configuration - where NGINX usually exits the existing worker processes gracefully. Some of these processes were sticking around for hours. Every config reload was dropping a zombie workers, permanently eating up all of your system's memory.

Setting `worker_shutdown_timeout` solve the issue:

```nginx
worker_shutdown_timeout 60s;
```

60 seconds matches our request and connect timeouts so nothing valid should last longer than that.

#### Connection processing

NGINX supports a variety of [connection processing methods](https://nginx.org/en/docs/events.html) which depends on the platform used.

In general there are four types of event multiplexing:

- `select` - is anachronism and not recommended but installed on all platforms as a fallback
- `poll` - is anachronism and not recommended

And the most efficient implementations of non-blocking I/O:

- `epoll` - recommend if you're using GNU/Linux
- `kqueue` - recommend if you're using BSD (it is technically superior to `epoll`)

The `select` method can be enabled or disabled using the `--with-select_module` or `--without-select_module` configuration parameter. Similarly, the `poll` method can be enabled or disabled using the `--with-poll_module` or `--without-poll_module` configuration parameter.

  > `epoll` is an efficient method of processing connections available on Linux 2.6+. `kqueue` is an efficient method of processing connections available on FreeBSD 4.1+, OpenBSD 2.9+, and NetBSD 2.0+.

There is normally no need to specify it explicitly, because NGINX will by default use the most efficient method. But if you want to set this:

```nginx
use epoll;
```

There are also great resources (also makes comparisons) about them:

You may also view why big players uses NGINX on FreeBSD instead of on GNU/Linux:

- [FreeBSD NGINX Performance](https://devinteske.com/wp/freebsd-nginx-performance/)
- [Why did Netflix use NGINX and FreeBSD to build their own CDN?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KP_bKvXkoC4)

NGINX means connections as follows (the following status information is provided by `ngx_http_stub_status_module`):

- **Active connections** - the current number of active (open) client connections including waiting connections and connections to backends
  - **accepts** - the total number of accepted client connections
  - **handled** - the total number of handled connections. Generally, the parameter value is the same as `accepts` unless some resource limits have been reached (for example, the `worker_connections` limit)
  - **requests** - the total number of client requests
- **Reading** - the current number of connections where NGINX is reading the request header
- **Writing** - the current number of connections where NGINX is writing the response back to the client (reads request body, processes request, or writes response to a client)
- **Waiting** - the current number of idle client connections waiting for a request, i.e. connection still opened waiting for either a new request, or the keepalive expiration (actually it is Active - (Reading + Writing))

  > Waiting connections those are keepalive connections. They are usually not a problem. But if you want to lower the number reduce `keepalive_timeout` directive.

##### Event-Driven architecture

  > [Thread Pools in NGINX Boost Performance 9x!](https://www.nginx.com/blog/thread-pools-boost-performance-9x/) - this official article is an amazing explanation about thread pools and generally about handling connections. I also recommend [Inside NGINX: How We Designed for Performance & Scale](https://www.nginx.com/blog/inside-nginx-how-we-designed-for-performance-scale). Both are really great.

NGINX uses Event-Driven architecture which heavily relies on Non-Blocking I/O. One advantage of non-blocking/asynchronous operations is that you can maximize the usage of a single CPU as well as memory because is that your thread can continue it's work in parallel. The end result is that even as load increases, memory and CPU usage remain manageable.

  > There is a perfectly good and brief [summary](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8546273/is-non-blocking-i-o-really-faster-than-multi-threaded-blocking-i-o-how) about non-blocking I/O and multi-threaded blocking I/O by [Werner Henze](https://stackoverflow.com/users/1023911/werner-henze). I also recommend [asynchronous vs non-blocking](https://stackoverflow.com/a/2625565) by [Daniel Earwicker](https://stackoverflow.com/users/27423/daniel-earwicker).

Take a look at this simple drawing:

<p align="center">
  <a href="http://faculty.salina.k-state.edu/tim/ossg/Device/blocking.html">
    <img src="https://github.com/trimstray/nginx-admins-handbook/blob/master/static/img/io/blocking_non-blocking.jpg" alt="blocking_non-blocking">
  </a>
</p>

<sup><i>This infographic comes from [Kansas State Polytechnic website](http://faculty.salina.k-state.edu/tim/ossg/Device/blocking.html).</i></sup>

Blocking I/O system calls (a) do not return until the I/O is complete. Nonblocking I/O system calls return immediately. The process is later notified when the I/O is complete.

There are forms of I/O and examples of POSIX functions:

| <b>Blocking</b> | <b>Non-blocking</b> | <b>Asynchronous</b> |
| :---         | :---         | :---         |
| `write`, `read` | `write`, `read` + `poll/select` | `aio_write`, `aio_read` |

Look also what the official documentation says about it:

  > _Itâ€™s well known that NGINX uses an asynchronous, eventâ€‘driven approach to handling connections. This means that instead of creating another dedicated process or thread for each request (like servers with a traditional architecture), it handles multiple connections and requests in one worker process. To achieve this, NGINX works with sockets in a nonâ€‘blocking mode and uses efficient methods such as epoll and kqueue._

  > _Because the number of fullâ€‘weight processes is small (usually only one per CPU core) and constant, much less memory is consumed and CPU cycles arenâ€™t wasted on task switching. The advantages of such an approach are wellâ€‘known through the example of NGINX itself. It successfully handles millions of simultaneous requests and scales very well._

I must not forget to mention here about Non-Blocking and 3rd party modules (from official documentation):

  > _Unfortunately, many thirdâ€‘party modules use blocking calls, and users (and sometimes even the developers of the modules) arenâ€™t aware of the drawbacks. Blocking operations can ruin NGINX performance and must be avoided at all costs._

To handle concurrent requests with a single worker process NGINX uses the [reactor design pattern](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5566653/simple-explanation-for-the-reactor-pattern-with-its-applications). Basically, it's a single-threaded but it can fork several processes to utilize multiple cores.

However, NGINX is not a single threaded application. Each of worker processes is single-threaded and can handle thousands of concurrent connections. NGINX does not create a new process/thread for each connection/requests but it starts several worker threads during start. It does this asynchronously with one thread, rather than using multi-threaded programming (it uses an event loop with asynchronous I/O).

That way, the I/O and network operations are not a very big bottleneck (remember that your CPU would spend a lot of time waiting for your network interfaces, for example). This results from the fact that NGINX only use one thread to service all requests. When requests arrive at the server, they are serviced one at a time. However, when the code serviced needs other thing to do it sends the callback to the other queue and the main thread will continue running (it doesn't wait).

Now you see why NGINX can handle a large amount of requests perfectly well (and without any problems).

##### Multiple processes

NGINX uses only asynchronous I/O, which makes blocking a non-issue. The only reason NGINX uses multiple processes is to make full use of multi-core, multi-CPU, and hyper-threading systems. NGINX requires only enough worker processes to get the full benefit of symmetric multiprocessing (SMP).

From official documentation:

  > _The NGINX configuration recommended in most cases - running one worker process per CPU core - makes the most efficient use of hardware resources._

NGINX uses a custom event loop which was designed specifically for NGINX - all connections are processed in a highly efficient run-loop in a limited number of single-threaded processes called workers.

Multiplexing works by using a loop to increment through a program chunk by chunk operating on one piece of data/new connection/whatever per connection/object per loop iteration. It is all based on events multiplexing like `epoll()`, `kqueue()`, or `select()`. Within each worker NGINX can handle many thousands of concurrent connections and requests per second.

  > See [Nginx Internals](https://www.slideshare.net/joshzhu/nginx-internals) presentation as a lot of great stuff about the internals of the NGINX.

NGINX does not fork a process or thread per connection (like Apache) so memory usage is very conservative and extremely efficient in the vast majority of cases. NGINX is a faster and consumes less memory than Apache and performs very well under load. It is also very friendly for CPU because there's no ongoing create-destroy pattern for processes or threads.

Finally and in summary:

- uses Non-Blocking "Event-Driven" architecture
- uses the single-threaded reactor pattern to handle concurrent requests
- uses highly efficient loop for connection processing
- is not a single threaded application because it starts multiple worker processes (to handle multiple connections and requests) during start

##### Simultaneous connections

Okay, so how many simultaneous connections can be processed by NGINX?

```
worker_processes * worker_connections = max connections
```

According to this: if you are running **4** worker processes with **4,096** worker connections per worker, you will be able to serve **16,384** connections. Of course, these are the NGINX settings limited by the kernel (number of connections, number of open files, or number of processes).

  > At this point, I would like to mention about [Understanding socket and port in TCP](https://medium.com/fantageek/understanding-socket-and-port-in-tcp-2213dc2e9b0c). It is a great and short explanation. I also recommend to read [Theoretical maximum number of open TCP connections that a modern Linux box can have](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2332741/what-is-the-theoretical-maximum-number-of-open-tcp-connections-that-a-modern-lin).

I've seen some admins does directly translate the sum of `worker_processes` and `worker_connections` into the number of clients that can be served simultaneously. In my opinion, it is a mistake because certain of clients (e.g. browsers which have different values for this) **opens a number of parallel connections** (see [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/985431/max-parallel-http-connections-in-a-browser) to confirm my words). Clients typically establish 4-8 TCP connections so that they can download resources in parallel (to download various components that compose a web page, for example, images, scripts, and so on). This increases the effective bandwidth and reduces latency.

  > That is a HTTP/1.1 limit (6-8) of concurrent HTTP calls, the best solution to improve performance (without upgrade the hardware and use cache at the middle (e.g. CDN, Varnish)) is using HTTP/2 ([RFC 7540](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7540) <sup>[IETF]</sup>) instead of HTTP/1.1.
  >
  > HTTP/2 multiplex many HTTP requests on a single connection. When HTTP/1.1 has a limit of 6-8 roughly, HTTP/2 does not have a standard limit but say that "_It is recommended that this value (`SETTINGS_MAX_CONCURRENT_STREAMS`) be no smaller than 100_" (RFC 7540). That number is better than 6-8.

Additionally, you must know that the `worker_connections` directive **includes all connections** per worker (e.g. connection structures are used for listen sockets, internal control sockets between NGINX processes, connections with proxied servers, and for upstream connections), not only incoming connections from clients.

  > Be aware that every worker connection (in the sleeping state) needs 256 bytes of memory, so you can increase it easily.

The number of connections is especially limited by the maximum number of open files (`RLIMIT_NOFILE`) on your system. The reason is that the operating system needs memory to manage each open file, and memory is a limited resource. This limitation only affects the limits for the current process. The limits of the current process are bequeathed to children processes too, but each process has a separate count.

To change the limit of the maximum file descriptors (that can be opened by a single worker process) you can also edit the `worker_rlimit_nofile` directive. With this, NGINX provides very powerful dynamic configuration capabilities with no service restarts.

  > The number of file descriptors is not the only one limitation of the number of connections - remember also about the kernel network (TCP/IP stack) parameters and the maximum number of processes.

I don't like this piece of the NGINX documentation. Maybe I'm missing something but it says the `worker_rlimit_nofile` is a limit on the maximum number of open files for worker processes. I believe it is associated to a single worker process.

If you set `RLIMIT_NOFILE` to 25,000 and `worker_rlimit_nofile` to 12,000, NGINX sets (only for workers) the maximum open files limit as a `worker_rlimit_nofile`. But the master process will have a set value of `RLIMIT_NOFILE`. Default value of `worker_rlimit_nofile` directive is `none` so by default NGINX sets the initial value of maximum open files from the system limits.

```bash
grep "LimitNOFILE" /lib/systemd/system/nginx.service
LimitNOFILE=5000

grep "worker_rlimit_nofile" /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
worker_rlimit_nofile 256;

   PID       SOFT HARD
 24430       5000 5000
 24431        256 256
 24432        256 256
 24433        256 256
 24434        256 256
```

This is also controlled by the OS because the worker is not the only process running on the machine. It would be very bad if your workers used up all of the file descriptors available to all processes, don't set your limits so that is possible.

In my opinion, relying on the `RLIMIT_NOFILE` than `worker_rlimit_nofile` value is more understandable and predictable. To be honest, it doesn't really matter which method is used to set, but you should keep a constant eye on the priority of the limits.

  > If you don't set the `worker_rlimit_nofile` directive manually, then the OS settings will determine how many file descriptors can be used by NGINX.

I think that the chance of running out of file descriptors is minimal, but it might be a big problem on a high traffic websites.

Ok, so how many fds are opens by NGINX?

- one file handler for the client's active connection
- one file handler for the proxied connection (that will open a socket handling these requests to remote or local host/process)
- one file handler for opening file (e.g. static file)
- other file handlers for internal connections, shared libraries, log files, and sockets

Also important is:

  > NGINX can use up to two file descriptors per full-fledged connection.

Look also at these diagrams:

- 1 file handler for connection with client and 1 file handler for static file being served by NGINX:

  ```
  # 1 connection, 2 file handlers

                       +-----------------+
  +----------+         |                 |
  |          |    1    |                 |
  |  CLIENT <---------------> NGINX      |
  |          |         |        ^        |
  +----------+         |        |        |
                       |      2 |        |
                       |        |        |
                       |        |        |
                       | +------v------+ |
                       | | STATIC FILE | |
                       | +-------------+ |
                       +-----------------+
  ```

- 1 file handler for connection with client and 1 file handler for a open socket to the remote or local host/process:

  ```
  # 2 connections, 2 file handlers

                       +-----------------+
  +----------+         |                 |         +-----------+
  |          |    1    |                 |    2    |           |
  |  CLIENT <---------------> NGINX <---------------> BACKEND  |
  |          |         |                 |         |           |
  +----------+         |                 |         +-----------+
                       +-----------------+
  ```

- 2 file handlers for two simultaneous connections from the same client (1, 4), 1 file handler for connection with other client (3), 2 file handlers for static files (2, 5), and 1 file handler for a open socket to the remote or local host/process (6), so in total it is 6 file descriptors:

  ```
  # 4 connections, 6 file handlers

                    4
        +-----------------------+
        |              +--------|--------+
  +-----v----+         |        |        |
  |          |    1    |        v        |  6
  |  CLIENT <-----+---------> NGINX <---------------+
  |          |    |    |        ^        |    +-----v-----+
  +----------+    |    |        |        |    |           |
                3 |    |      2 | 5      |    |  BACKEND  |
  +----------+    |    |        |        |    |           |
  |          |    |    |        |        |    +-----------+
  |  CLIENT  <----+    | +------v------+ |
  |          |         | | STATIC FILE | |
  +----------+         | +-------------+ |
                       +-----------------+
  ```

In the first two examples: we can take that NGINX needs 2 file handlers for full-fledged connection (but still uses 2 worker connections). In the third example NGINX can take still 2 file handlers for every full-fledged connection (also if client uses parallel connections).

So, to conclude, I think that the correct value of `worker_rlimit_nofile` per all connections of worker should be greater than `worker_connections`.

In my opinion, the safe value of `worker_rlimit_nofile` (and system limits) is:

```
# 1 file handler for 1 connection:
worker_connections + (shared libs, log files, event pool, etc.) = worker_rlimit_nofile

# 2 file handlers for 1 connection:
(worker_connections * 2) + (shared libs, log files, event pool, etc.) = worker_rlimit_nofile
```

That is probably how many files can be opened by each worker and should have a value greater than to the number of connections per worker (according to the above formula).

In the most articles and tutorials we can see that this parameter has a value similar to the maximum number (or even more) of all open files by the NGINX. If we assume that this parameter applies to each worker separately these values are altogether excessive.

However, after a deeper reflection they are rational because they allow one worker to use all the file descriptors so that they are not confined to other workers if something happens to them. Remember though that we are still limited by the connections per worker. May I remind you that any connection opens at least one file.

So, moving on, the maximum number of open files by the NGINX should be:

```
(worker_processes * worker_connections * 2) + (shared libs, log files, event pool, etc.) = max open files
```

  > To serve **16,384** connections by all workers (4,096 connections for each worker), and bearing in mind about the other handlers used by NGINX, a reasonably value of max files handlers in this case may be **35,000**. I think it's more than enough.

Given the above to change/improve the limitations you should:

1. Edit the maximum, total, global number of file descriptors the kernel will allocate before choking (this step is optional, I think you should change this only for a very very high traffic):

    ```bash
    # Find out the system-wide maximum number of file handles:
    sysctl fs.file-max

    # Shows the current number of all file descriptors in kernel memory:
    #   first value:  <allocated file handles>
    #  second value:  <unused-but-allocated file handles>
    #   third value:  <the system-wide maximum number of file handles> # fs.file-max
    sysctl fs.file-nr

    # Set it manually and temporarily:
    sysctl -w fs.file-max=150000

    # Set it permanently:
    echo "fs.file-max = 150000" > /etc/sysctl.d/99-fs.conf

    # And load new values of kernel parameters:
    sysctl -p       # for /etc/sysctl.conf
    sysctl --system # for /etc/sysctl.conf and all of the system configuration files
    ```

2. Edit the system-wide value of the maximum file descriptor number that can be opened by a single process:

    - for non-systemd systems:

      ```bash
      # Set the maximum number of file descriptors for the users logged in via PAM:
      #   /etc/security/limits.conf
      nginx       soft    nofile    35000
      nginx       hard    nofile    35000
      ```

    - for systemd systems:

      ```bash
      # Set the maximum number (hard limit) of file descriptors for the services started via systemd:
      #   /etc/systemd/system.conf          - global config (default values for all units)
      #   /etc/systemd/user.conf            - this specifies further per-user restrictions
      #   /lib/systemd/system/nginx.service - default unit for the NGINX service
      #   /etc/systemd/system/nginx.service - for your own instance of the NGINX service
      [Service]
      # ...
      LimitNOFILE=35000

      # Reload a unit file and restart the NGINX service:
      systemctl daemon-reload && systemct restart nginx
      ```

3.  Adjusts the system limit on number of open files for the NGINX worker. The maximum value can not be greater than `LimitNOFILE` (in this example: 35,000). You can change it at any time:

    ```bash
    # Set the limit for file descriptors for a single worker process (change it as needed):
    #   nginx.conf within the main context
    worker_rlimit_nofile          10000;

    # You need to reload the NGINX service:
    nginx -s reload
    ```

To show the current hard and soft limits applying to the NGINX processes (with `nofile`, `LimitNOFILE`, or `worker_rlimit_nofile`):

```bash
for _pid in $(pgrep -f "nginx: [master,worker]") ; do

  echo -en "$_pid "
  grep "Max open files" /proc/${_pid}/limits | awk '{print $4" "$5}'

done | xargs printf '%6s %10s\t%s\n%6s %10s\t%s\n' "PID" "SOFT" "HARD"
```

or use the following:

```bash
# To determine the OS limits imposed on a process, read the file /proc/$pid/limits.
# $pid corresponds to the PID of the process:
for _pid in $(pgrep -f "nginx: [master,worker]") ; do

  echo -en ">>> $_pid\\n"
  cat /proc/$_pid/limits

done
```

To list the current open file descriptors for each NGINX process:

```bash
for _pid in $(pgrep -f "nginx: [master,worker]") ; do

  _fds=$(find /proc/${_pid}/fd/*)
  _fds_num=$(echo "$_fds" | wc -l)

  echo -en "\n\n##### PID: $_pid ($_fds_num fds) #####\n\n"

  # List all files from the proc/{pid}/fd directory:
  echo -en "$_fds\n\n"

  # List all open files (log files, memory mapped files, libs):
  lsof -as -p $_pid | awk '{if(NR>1)print}'

done
```

You should also remember about the following rules:

- `worker_rlimit_nofile` serves to dynamically change the maximum file descriptors the NGINX worker processes can handle, which is typically defined with the system's soft limit (`ulimit -Sn`)

- `worker_rlimit_nofile` works only at the process level, it's limited to the system's hard limit (`ulimit -Hn`)

- if you have SELinux enabled, you will need to run `setsebool -P httpd_setrlimit 1` so that NGINX has permissions to set its rlimit. To diagnose SELinux denials and attempts you can use `sealert -a /var/log/audit/audit.log`, or `audit2why` and `audit2allow` tools

To sum up this example:

- each of the NGINX processes (master + workers) have the ability to create up to 35,000 files
- for all workers, the maximum number of file descriptors is 140,000 (`LimitNOFILE` per worker)
- for each worker, the initial/current number of file descriptors is 10,000 (`worker_rlimit_nofile`)

```
nginx: master process         = LimitNOFILE (35,000)
  \_ nginx: worker process    = LimitNOFILE (35,000), worker_rlimit_nofile (10,000)
  \_ nginx: worker process    = LimitNOFILE (35,000), worker_rlimit_nofile (10,000)
  \_ nginx: worker process    = LimitNOFILE (35,000), worker_rlimit_nofile (10,000)
  \_ nginx: worker process    = LimitNOFILE (35,000), worker_rlimit_nofile (10,000)

                              = master (35,000), all workers (140,000 or 40,000)
```

##### HTTP Keep-Alive connections

  > **:bookmark: [Activate the cache for connections to upstream servers - Performance - P2](RULES.md#beginner-activate-the-cache-for-connections-to-upstream-servers)**

Before starting this section I recommend to read the following articles:

- [HTTP Keepalive Connections and Web Performance](https://www.nginx.com/blog/http-keepalives-and-web-performance/)
- [Optimizing HTTP: Keep-alive and Pipelining](https://www.igvita.com/2011/10/04/optimizing-http-keep-alive-and-pipelining/)
- [Evolution of HTTP â€” HTTP/0.9, HTTP/1.0, HTTP/1.1, Keep-Alive, Upgrade, and HTTPS](https://medium.com/platform-engineer/evolution-of-http-69cfe6531ba0)

The original model of HTTP, and the default one in HTTP/1.0, is short-lived connections. Each HTTP request is completed on its own connection; this means a TCP handshake happens before each HTTP request, and these are serialized. The client creates a new TCP connection for each transaction (and the connection is torn down after the transaction completes).

HTTP Keep-Alive connection or persistent connection is the idea of using a single TCP connection to send and receive multiple HTTP requests/responses (Keep Alive's work between requests), as opposed to opening a new connection for every single request/response pair.

When using keep alive the browser does not have to make multiple connections (keep in mind that establishing connections is expensive). But uses the already established connection, this controls how long that stays active/open. So, the keep alive is a way to reduce the overhead of creating the connection, as, most of the time, a user will navigate through the site etc. (plus the multiple requests from a single page, to download css, javascript, images etc.).

It takes a 3-way handshake to establish a TCP connection, so, when there is a perceivable latency between the client and the server, keepalive would greatly speed things up by reusing existing connections.

This mechanism hold open the TCP connection between the client and the server after an HTTP transaction has completed. It's important because NGINX needs to close connections from time to time, even if you configure NGINX to allow infinite keep alive timeouts and a huge amount of acceptable requests per connection, to return results and as well errors and success messages.

</p>

Persistent connection model keeps connections opened between successive requests, reducing the time needed to open new connections. The HTTP pipelining model goes one step further, by sending several successive requests without even waiting for an answer, reducing much of the latency in the network.

<sup><i>This infographic comes from [Mozilla MDN - Connection management in HTTP/1.x](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Connection_management_in_HTTP_1.x).</i></sup>

However, at present, browsers are not using pipelined HTTP requests. For more information please see [Why is pipelining disabled in modern browsers?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30477476/why-is-pipelining-disabled-in-modern-browsers).

Look also at this example that shows how a Keep-Alive header could be used:

```
 Client                        Proxy                         Server
   |                             |                              |
   +- Keep-Alive: timeout=600 -->|                              |
   |  Connection: Keep-Alive     |                              |
   |                             +- Keep-Alive: timeout=1200 -->|
   |                             |  Connection: Keep-Alive      |
   |                             |                              |
   |                             |<-- Keep-Alive: timeout=300 --+
   |                             |    Connection: Keep-Alive    |
   |<- Keep-Alive: timeout=5000 -+                              |
   |    Connection: Keep-Alive   |                              |
   |                             |                              |
```

NGINX official documentation says:

  > _All connections are independently negotiated. The client indicates a timeout of 600 seconds (10 minutes), but the proxy is only prepared to retain the connection for at least 120 seconds (2 minutes). On the link between proxy and server, the proxy requests a timeout of 1200 seconds and the server reduces this to 300 seconds. As this example shows, the timeout policies maintained by the proxy are different for each connection. Each connection hop is independent._

Keepalive connections reduce overhead, especially when SSL/TLS is in use but they also have drawbacks; even when idling they consume server resources, and under heavy load, DoS attacks can be conducted. In such cases, using non-persistent connections, which are closed as soon as they are idle, can provide better performance. So, Keep-Alives will improve SSL/TLS performance by quite a big deal if clients are doing multiple requests but if you don't have the resources to handle them then they kill your servers.

  > NGINX closes keepalive connections when the `worker_connections` limit is reached (connections are kept in the cache till the origin server closes them).

To better understand how Keep-Alive works, please see amazing [explanation](https://stackoverflow.com/a/38190172) by [Barry Pollard](https://stackoverflow.com/users/2144578/barry-pollard).

NGINX provides the two layers to enable Keep-Alive:

###### Client layer

- the maximum number of keepalive requests a client can make over a given connection, which means a client can make e.g. 256 successfull requests inside one keepalive connection:

  ```nginx
  # Default: 100
  keepalive_requests  256;
  ```

- server will close connection after this time. A higher number may be required when there is a larger amount of traffic to ensure there is no frequent TCP connection re-initiated. If you set it lower, you are not utilizing keep-alives on most of your requests slowing down client:

  ```nginx
  # Default: 75s
  keepalive_timeout   10s;

  # Or tell the browser when it should close the connection by adding an optional second timeout
  # in the header sent to the browser (some browsers do not care about the header):
  keepalive_timeout   10s 25s;
  ```

  > Increase this to allow the keepalive connection to stay open longer, resulting in faster subsequent requests. However, setting this too high will result in the waste of resources (mainly memory) as the connection will remain open even if there is no traffic, potentially: significantly affecting performance. I think this should be as close to your average response time as possible. You could also decrease little by little the timeout (75s -> 50, then later 25...) and see how the server behaves.

###### Upstream layer

- the number of idle keepalive connections that remain open for each worker process. The connections parameter sets the maximum number of idle keepalive connections to upstream servers that are preserved in the cache of each worker process (when this number is exceeded, the least recently used connections are closed):

  ```nginx
  # Default: disable
  keepalive         32;
  ```

NGINX, by default, only talks HTTP/1.0 to the upstream servers. To keep TCP connection alive both upstream section and origin server should be configured to not finalise the connection.

  > Please keep in mind that keepalive is a feature of HTTP 1.1, NGINX uses HTTP 1.0 per default for upstreams.

Connection won't be reused by default because keepalive in the upstream section means no keepalive (each time you can see TCP stream number increases per every request to origin server).

HTTP keepalive enabled in NGINX upstream servers reduces latency thus improves performance and it reduces the possibility that the NGINX runs out of ephemeral ports.

  > The connections parameter should be set to a number small enough to let upstream servers process new incoming connections as well.

Update your upstream configuration to use keepalive:

```nginx
upstream bk_x8080 {

  ...

  # Sets the maximum number of idle keepalive connections to upstream servers
  # that are preserved in the cache of each worker process.
  keepalive         16;

}
```

And enable the HTTP/1.1 protocol in all upstream requests:

```nginx
server {

  ...

  location / {

    # Default is HTTP/1, keepalive is only enabled in HTTP/1.1:
    proxy_http_version  1.1;
    # Remove the Connection header if the client sends it,
    # it could be "close" to close a keepalive connection:
    proxy_set_header    Connection "";

    proxy_pass          http://bk_x8080;

  }

}

...

}
```

There are two basic cases when keeping connections alive is really beneficial:

- fast backends, which produce responses is a very short time, comparable to a TCP handshake
- distant backends, when a TCP handshake takes a long time, comparable to a backend response time

Look at the test:

- without keepalive for upstream:

```bash
wrk -c 500 -t 6 -d 60s -R 15000 -H "Host: example.com" https://example.com/
Running 1m test @ https://example.com/
  6 threads and 500 connections

    Latency    24.13s    10.68s   49.55s    59.06%
    Req/Sec   679.21     42.44   786.00     78.95%
  228421 requests in 1.00m, 77.98MB read
  Socket errors: connect 0, read 0, write 0, timeout 1152
  Non-2xx or 3xx responses: 4
Requests/sec:   3806.96
Transfer/sec:      1.30MB
```

- with keepalive for upstream:

```bash
wrk -c 500 -t 6 -d 60s -R 15000 -H "Host: example.com" https://example.com/
Running 1m test @ https://example.com/
  6 threads and 500 connections
  Thread Stats   Avg      Stdev     Max   +/- Stdev
    Latency    23.40s     9.53s   47.25s    60.67%
    Req/Sec     0.86k    50.19     0.94k    60.00%

```

##### `sendfile`, `tcp_nodelay`, and `tcp_nopush`

Before you start reading please review:

- [Nginx optimization, understanding SENDFILE, TCP_NODELAY and TCP_NOPUSH](https://thoughts.t37.net/nginx-optimization-understanding-sendfile-tcp-nodelay-and-tcp-nopush-c55cdd276765)
- [Nginx Tutorial #2: Performance](https://www.netguru.com/codestories/nginx-tutorial-performance)

As you're making these changes, keep careful watch on your network traffic and see how each tweak impacts congestion.

###### `sendfile`

  > _By default, NGINX handles file transmission itself and copies the file into the buffer before sending it. Enabling the `sendfile` directive eliminates the step of copying the data into the buffer and enables direct copying data from one file descriptor to another._

Normally, when a file needs to be sent, the following steps are required:

- `malloc` - allocate a local buffer for storing object data
- `read` - retrieve and copy the object into the local buffer
- `write` - copy the object from the local buffer into the socket buffer

Look at this great explanation (from [Nginx Tutorial #2: Performance](https://www.netguru.com/codestories/nginx-tutorial-performance)):

  > _This involves two context switches (read, write) which make a second copy of the same object unnecessary. As you may see, it is not the optimal way. Thankfully, there is another system call that improves sending files, and it's called (surprise, surprise!): `sendfile(2)`. This call retrieves an object to the file cache, and passes the pointers (without copying the whole object) straight to the socket descriptor. Netflix states that using `sendfile(2)` increased the network throughput from [6Gbps to 30Gbps](https://people.freebsd.org/~rrs/asiabsd_2015_tls.pdf)._

When a file is transferred by a process, the kernel first buffers the data and then sends the data to the process buffers. The process, in turn, sends the data to the destination.

NGINX employs a solution that uses the `sendfile` system call to perform a zero-copy data flow from disk to socket and saves context switching from userspace on read/write. `sendfile` tell how NGINX buffers or reads the file (trying to stuff the contents directly into the network slot, or buffer its contents first).

This method is an improved method of data transfer, in which data is copied between file descriptors within the OS kernel space, that is, without transferring data to the application buffers. No additional buffers or data copies are required, and the data never leaves the kernel memory address space.

In my opinion enabling this really won't make any difference unless NGINX is reading from something which can be mapped into the virtual memory space like a file (i.e. the data is in the cache). But please... do not let me influence you - you should in the first place be keeping an eye on this document: [Optimizing TLS for Highâ€“Bandwidth Applications in FreeBSD](https://people.freebsd.org/~rrs/asiabsd_2015_tls.pdf).

By default NGINX disable the use of `sendfile`:

```nginx
# http, server, location, if in location contexts
# To turn on sendfile (my recommendation):
sendfile on;

# To turn off sendfile:
sendfile off;     # default
```

Look also at `sendfile_max_chunk` directive. NGINX documentation say:

  > _When set to a non-zero value, limits the amount of data that can be transferred in a single `sendfile()` call. Without the limit, one fast connection may seize the worker process entirely._

On fast local connection `sendfile()` in Linux may send tens of megabytes per one syscall blocking other connections. `sendfile_max_chunk` allows to limit the maximum size per one `sendfile()` operation. So, with this NGINX  can reduce the maximum time spent in blocking sendfile() calls, since NGINX wonâ€™t try to send the whole file at once, but will do it in chunks. For example:

```nginx
sendfile on;
sendfile_max_chunk 512k;
```

###### `tcp_nodelay`

I recommend to read [The Caveats of TCP_NODELAY](https://eklitzke.org/the-caveats-of-tcp-nodelay) and [Rethinking the TCP Nagle Algorithm](http://ccr.sigcomm.org/archive/2001/jan01/ccr-200101-mogul.pdf). These great papers describes very interesting topics about `TCP_NODELAY` and `TCP_NOPUSH`.

`tcp_nodelay` is used to manage Nagle's algorithm which is one mechanism for improving TCP efficiency by reducing the number of small packets sent over the network. If you set `tcp_nodelay on;`, NGINX adds the `TCP_NODELAY` options when opening a new socket.

  > The option only affects keep-alive connections. Otherwise there is 100ms delay when NGINX sends response tail in the last incomplete TCP packet. Additionally, it is enabled on SSL connections, for unbuffered proxying, and for WebSocket proxying.

Maybe you should think about enabling Nagle's algorithm (`tcp_nodelay off;`) but it really depends on what is your specific workload and dominant traffic patterns on a service. `tcp_nodelay on;` is more reasonable for the modern web, the whole delay business of TCP was reasonable for terminals. Typically LANs have less issues with traffic congestion as compared to the WANs. The Nagle algorithm is most effective if TCP/IP traffic is generated sporadically by user input, not by applications using stream oriented protocols like a HTTP traffic.

So, for me, the recipe is simple:

- bulk sends or HTTP traffic
- applications that require lower latency
- non-interactive type of traffic

There is no need for using Nagle's algorithm.

You should also know [the Nagleâ€™s algorithm author's interesting comment](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9045125):

  > _If you're doing bulk file transfers, you never hit that problem. If you're sending enough data to fill up outgoing buffers, there's no delay. If you send all the data and close the TCP connection, there's no delay after the last packet. If you do send, reply, send, reply, there's no delay. If you do bulk sends, there's no delay. If you do send, send, reply, there's a delay._

  > _The real problem is ACK delays. The 200ms "ACK delay" timer is a bad idea that someone at Berkeley stuck into BSD around 1985 because they didn't really understand the problem. A delayed ACK is a bet that there will be a reply from the application level within 200ms. TCP continues to use delayed ACKs even if it's losing that bet every time._

I think if you are dealing with non-interactive type of traffic or bulk transfers such as HTTP/web traffic then enabling `TCP_NODELAY` to disable Nagle's algorithm may be useful (is the default behavior of the NGINX). This is especially relevant if you're running applications or environments that only sometimes have highly interactive traffic and chatty protocols.

By default NGINX enable the use of `TCP_NODELAY` option:

```nginx
# http, server, location contexts
# To turn on tcp_nodelay and at the same time to disable Nagleâ€™s algorithm
# (my recommendation, unless you turn tcp_nopush on):
tcp_nodelay on;   # default

# To turn off tcp_nodelay and at the same time to enable Nagleâ€™s algorithm:
tcp_nodelay off;
```

###### `tcp_nopush`

This option is only available if you are using `sendfile` (NGINX uses `tcp_nopush` for requests served with `sendfile`). It causes NGINX to attempt to send its HTTP response head in one packet, instead of using partial frames. This is useful for prepending headers before calling `sendfile`, or for throughput optimization.

  > Normally, using `tcp_nopush` along with `sendfile` is very good. However, there are some cases where it can slow down things (specially from cache systems), so, run your own tests and find if itâ€™s useful in that way.

`tcp_nopush` enables `TCP_CORK` (more specifically, the `TCP_NOPUSH` socket option on FreeBSD or the `TCP_CORK` socket option on Linux) which aggressively accumulates data and which tells TCP to wait for the application to remove the cork before sending any packets.

If `TCP_NOPUSH/TCP_CORK` (are not the same!) is enabled in a socket, it will not send data until the buffer fills to a fixed limit (allows application to control building of packet, e.g pack a packet with full HTTP response). To read more about it and get into the details of this option please read [TCP_CORK: More than you ever wanted to know](https://baus.net/on-tcp_cork/).

Once, I read that `tcp_nopush` is opposite to `tcp_nodelay`. I don't agree with that because, as I understand it, the first one aggregates data based on buffer pressure instead whereas Nagle's algorithm aggregates data while waiting for a return ACK, which the latter option disables.

It may appear that `tcp_nopush` and `tcp_nodelay` are mutually exclusive but if all directives are turned on, NGINX manages them very wisely:

- ensure packages are full before sending them to the client
- for the last packet, `tcp_nopush` will be removed, allowing TCP to send it immediately, without the 200ms delay

And let's also remember (take a look at [Tony Finch notes](http://dotat.at/writing/nopush.html) - this guy developed a kernel patch for FreeBSD which makes `TCP_NOPUSH` work like `TCP_CORK`):

- on Linux, `sendfile()` depends on the `TCP_CORK` socket option to avoid undesirable packet boundaries
- FreeBSD has a similar option called `TCP_NOPUSH`
- when `TCP_CORK` is turned off any buffered data is sent immediately, but this is not the case for `TCP_NOPUSH`

By default NGINX disable the use of `TCP_NOPUSH` option:

```nginx
# http, server, location contexts
# To turn on tcp_nopush (my recommendation):
tcp_nopush on;

# To turn off tcp_nopush:
tcp_nopush off;   # default
```

###### Mixing all together

There are many opinions on this. My recommendation is to set all to `on`. However, I quote an interesting comment ([Mixing sendfile, tcp_nodelay and tcp_nopush illogical?](https://github.com/denji/nginx-tuning/issues/5)) that should dispel any doubts:

  > _When set indicates to always queue non-full frames. Later the user clears this option and we transmit any pending partial frames in the queue. This is meant to be used alongside `sendfile()` to get properly filled frames when the user (for example) must write out headers with a `write()` call first and then use `sendfile` to send out the data parts. `TCP_CORK` can be set together with `TCP_NODELAY` and it is stronger than `TCP_NODELAY`._

Summarizing:

- `tcp_nodelay on;` is generaly at the odds with `tcp_nopush on;` as they are mutually exclusive
- NGINX has special behavior that if you have `sendfile on;`, it uses `TCP_NOPUSH` for everything but the last package
- and then turns `TCP_NOPUSH` off and enables `TCP_NODELAY` to avoid 200ms ACK delay

So in fact, the most important changes are listed below:

```nginx
sendfile   on;
tcp_nopush on;    # with this, the tcp_nodelay does not really matter
```

#### Request processing stages

  > When building filtering rules (e.g. with `allow/deny`) you should always remember to test them and what is happening on each of phases (which modules are used). For additional information, look at [allow and deny](#allow-and-deny) section.

There can be altogether 11 phases when NGINX handles (processes) a request:

#### Server blocks logic

  > NGINX does have **server blocks** (like a virtual hosts in an Apache) that use `listen` directive to bind to TCP sockets and `server_name` directive to identify virtual hosts.

It's a short example of two server block contexts with several regular expressions:

```nginx
http {

  index index.html;
  root /var/www/example.com/default;

  server {

    listen 10.10.250.10:80;
    server_name www.example.com;

    access_log logs/example.access.log main;

    root /var/www/example.com/public;

    location ~ ^/(static|media)/ { ... }

    location ~* /[0-9][0-9](-.*)(\.html)$ { ... }

    location ~* \.(jpe?g|png|gif|ico)$ { ... }

    location ~* (?<begin>.*app)/(?<end>.+\.php)$ { ... }

    ...

  }

  server {

    listen 10.10.250.11:80;
    server_name "~^(api.)?example\.com api.de.example.com";

    access_log logs/example.access.log main;

    location ~ ^(/[^/]+)/api(.*)$ { ... }

    location ~ ^/backend/id/([a-z]\.[a-z]*) { ... }

    ...

  }

}
```

##### Handle incoming connections

NGINX uses the following logic to determining which virtual server (server block) should be used:

1. Match the `address:port` pair to the `listen` directive - that can be multiple server blocks with `listen` directives of the same specificity that can handle the request

    > NGINX use the `address:port` combination for handle incoming connections. This pair is assigned to the `listen` directive.

    The `listen` directive can be set to:

      - an IP address/port combination (`127.0.0.1:80;`)

      - a lone IP address, if only address is given, the port `80` is used (`127.0.0.1;`) - becomes `127.0.0.1:80;`

      - a lone port which will listen to every interface on that port (`80;` or `*:80;`) - becomes `0.0.0.0:80;`

      - the path to a UNIX domain socket (`unix:/var/run/nginx.sock;`)

    If the `listen` directive is not present then either `*:80` is used (runs with the superuser privileges), or `*:8000` otherwise.

    To play with `listen` directive NGINX must follow the following steps:

      - NGINX translates all incomplete `listen` directives by substituting missing values with their default values (see above)

      - NGINX attempts to collect a list of the server blocks that match the request most specifically based on the `address:port`

      - If any block that is functionally using `0.0.0.0`, will not be selected if there are matching blocks that list a specific IP

      - If there is only one most specific match, that server block will be used to serve the request

      - If there are multiple server blocks with the same level of matching, NGINX then begins to evaluate the `server_name` directive of each server block

    Look at this short example:

    ```nginx
    # From client side:
    GET / HTTP/1.0
    Host: api.random.com

    # From server side:
    server {

      # This block will be processed:
      listen 192.168.252.10;  # --> 192.168.252.10:80

      ...

    }

    server {

      listen 80;  # --> *:80 --> 0.0.0.0:80
      server_name api.random.com;

      ...

    }
    ```

2. Match the `Host` header field against the `server_name` directive as a string (the exact names hash table)

3. Match the `Host` header field against the `server_name` directive with a
wildcard at the beginning of the string (the hash table with wildcard names starting with an asterisk)

    > If one is found, that block will be used to serve the request. If multiple matches are found, the longest match will be used to serve the request.

4. Match the `Host` header field against the `server_name` directive with a
wildcard at the end of the string (the hash table with wildcard names ending with an asterisk)

    > If one is found, that block is used to serve the request. If multiple matches are found, the longest match will be used to serve the request.

5. Match the `Host` header field against the `server_name` directive as a regular expression

    > The first `server_name` with a regular expression that matches the `Host` header will be used to serve the request.

6. If all the `Host` headers doesn't match, then direct to the `listen` directive marked as `default_server` (makes the server block answer all the requests that doesnâ€™t match any server block)

7. If all the `Host` headers doesn't match and there is no `default_server`,
direct to the first server with a `listen` directive that satisfies first step

8. Finally, NGINX goes to the `location` context

<sup><i>This list is based on [Mastering Nginx - The virtual server section](https://github.com/trimstray/nginx-admins-handbook#mastering-nginx).</i></sup>

##### Matching location

  > **:bookmark: [Make an exact location match to speed up the selection process - Performance - P3](RULES.md#beginner-make-an-exact-location-match-to-speed-up-the-selection-process)**

  > For each request, NGINX goes through a process to choose the best location block that will be used to serve that request.

The location block enables you to handle several types of URIs/routes, within a server block. Syntax looks like:

```
location optional_modifier location_match { ... }
```

`location_match` in the above defines what NGINX should check the request URI against. The `optional_modifier` below will cause the associated location block to be interpreted as follows (the order doesn't matter at this moment):

- `(none)`: if no modifiers are present, the location is interpreted as a prefix match. To determine a match, the location will now be matched against the beginning of the URI

- `=`: is an exact match, without any wildcards, prefix matching or regular expressions; forces a literal match between the request URI and the location parameter

- `~`: if a tilde modifier is present, this location must be used for case sensitive matching (RE match)

- `~*`: if a tilde and asterisk modifier is used, the location must be used for case insensitive matching (RE match)

- `^~`: assuming this block is the best non-RE match, a carat followed by a tilde modifier means that RE matching will not take place

And now, a short introduction to determines location priority:

- the exact match is the best priority (processed first); ends search if match

- the prefix match is the second priority; there are two types of prefixes: `^~` and `(none)`, if this match used the `^~` prefix, searching stops

- the regular expression match has the lowest priority; there are two types of prefixes: `~` and `~*`; in the order they are defined in the configuration file

- if regular expression searching yielded a match, that result is used, otherwise, the match from prefix searching is used

So look at this example, it comes from the [Nginx documentation - ngx_http_core_module](https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_core_module.html#location):

```
location = / {
  # Matches the query / only.
  [ configuration A ]
}
location / {
  # Matches any query, since all queries begin with /, but regular
  # expressions and any longer conventional blocks will be
  # matched first.
  [ configuration B ]
}
location /documents/ {
  # Matches any query beginning with /documents/ and continues searching,
  # so regular expressions will be checked. This will be matched only if
  # regular expressions don't find a match.
  [ configuration C ]
}
location ^~ /images/ {
  # Matches any query beginning with /images/ and halts searching,
  # so regular expressions will not be checked.
  [ configuration D ]
}
location ~* \.(gif|jpg|jpeg)$ {
  # Matches any request ending in gif, jpg, or jpeg. However, all
  # requests to the /images/ directory will be handled by
  # Configuration D.
  [ configuration E ]
}
```

To help you understand how does location match works:

- [Nginx location match tester](https://nginx.viraptor.info/)
- [Nginx location match visible](https://detailyang.github.io/nginx-location-match-visible/)
- [NGINX Regular Expression Tester](https://github.com/nginxinc/NGINX-Demos/tree/master/nginx-regex-tester)

The process of choosing NGINX location block is as follows (a detailed explanation):

1. NGINX searches for an exact match. If a `=` modifier exactly matches the request URI, this specific location block is chosen right away

2. Prefix-based NGINX location matches (no regular expression). Each location will be checked against the request URI. If no exact (meaning no `=` modifier) location block is found, NGINX will continue with non-exact prefixes. It starts with the longest matching prefix location for this URI, with the following approach:

    - In case the longest matching prefix location has the `^~` modifier, NGINX will stop its search right away and choose this location.

    - Assuming the longest matching prefix location doesnâ€™t use the `^~` modifier, the match is temporarily stored and the process continues.

    > I'm not sure about the order. In the official documentation it is not clearly indicated and external guides explain it differently. It seems logical to check the longest matching prefix location first.

3. As soon as the longest matching prefix location is chosen and stored, NGINX continues to evaluate the case-sensitive and insensitive regular expression locations. The first regular expression location that fits the URI is selected right away to process the request

4. If no regular expression locations are found that match the request URI, the previously stored prefix location is selected to serve the request

In order to better understand how this process work please see this short cheatsheet that will allow you to design your location blocks in a predictable way:

Ok, so here's a more complicated configuration:

```nginx
server {

 listen           80;
 server_name      xyz.com www.xyz.com;

 location ~ ^/(media|static)/ {
  root            /var/www/xyz.com/static;
  expires         10d;
 }

 location ~* ^/(media2|static2) {
  root            /var/www/xyz.com/static2;
  expires         20d;
 }

 location /static3 {
  root            /var/www/xyz.com/static3;
 }

 location ^~ /static4 {
  root            /var/www/xyz.com/static4;
 }

 location = /api {
  proxy_pass      http://127.0.0.1:8080;
 }

 location / {
  proxy_pass      http://127.0.0.1:8080;
 }

 location /backend {
  proxy_pass      http://127.0.0.1:8080;
 }

 location ~ logo.xcf$ {
  root            /var/www/logo;
  expires         48h;
 }

 location ~* .(png|ico|gif|xcf)$ {
  root            /var/www/img;
  expires         24h;
 }

 location ~ logo.ico$ {
  root            /var/www/logo;
  expires         96h;
 }

 location ~ logo.jpg$ {
  root            /var/www/logo;
  expires         48h;
 }

}
```

And here's the table with the results:

##### `rewrite` vs `return`

Generally there are two ways of implementing redirects in NGINX with: `rewrite` and `return`.

These directives (comes from the `ngx_http_rewrite_module`) are very useful but (from the NGINX documentation) the only 100% safe things which may be done inside if in a location context are:

- `return ...;`
- `rewrite ... last;`

Anything else may possibly cause unpredictable behaviour, including potential `SIGSEGV`.

###### `rewrite` directive

The `rewrite` directives are executed sequentially in order of their appearance in the configuration file. It's slower (but still extremely fast) than a `return` and returns HTTP 302 in all cases, irrespective of `permanent`.

The `rewrite` directive just changes the request URI, not the response of request. Importantly only the part of the original url that matches the regex is rewritten. It can be used for temporary url changes.

I sometimes used `rewrite` to capture elementes in the original URL, change or add elements in the path, and in general when I do something more complex:

```nginx
location / {

  ...

  rewrite   ^/users/(.*)$       /user.php?username=$1 last;

  # or:
  rewrite   ^/users/(.*)/items$ /user.php?username=$1&page=items last;

}
```

  > You must know that rewrite returns only code 301 or 302.

`rewrite` directive accept optional flags:

- `break` - basically completes processing of rewrite directives, stops processing, and breakes location lookup cycle by not doing any location lookup and internal jump at all

  - if you use `break` flag inside `location` block:

    - no more parsing of rewrite conditions
    - internal engine continues to parse the current `location` block

    _Inside a location block, with `break`, NGINX only stops processing anymore rewrite conditions._

  - if you use `break` flag outside `location` block:

    - no more parsing of rewrite conditions
    - internal engine goes to the next phase (searching for `location` match)

    _Outside a location block, with `break`, NGINX stops processing anymore rewrite conditions._

- `last` - basically completes processing of rewrite directives, stops processing, and starts a search for a new location matching the changed URI

  - if you use `last` flag inside `location` block:

    - no more parsing of rewrite conditions
    - internal engine **starts to look** for another location match based on the result of the rewrite result
    - no more parsing of rewrite conditions, even on the next location match

    _Inside a location block, with last, NGINX stops processing anymore rewrite conditions and then **starts to look** for a new matching of location block. NGINX also ignores any rewrites in the new location block._

  - if you use `last` flag outside `location` block:

    - no more parsing of rewrite conditions
    - internal engine goes to the next phase (searching for `location` match)

    _Outside a location block, with `last`, NGINX stops processing anymore rewrite conditions._

- `redirect` - returns a temporary redirect with the 302 HTTP response code
- `permanent` - returns a permanent redirect with the 301 HTTP response code

Note:

- that outside location blocks, `last` and `break` are effectively the same
- processing of rewrite directives at server level may be stopped via `break`, but the location lookup will follow anyway

<sup><i>This explanation is based on the awesome answer by [Pothi Kalimuthu](https://serverfault.com/users/102173/pothi-kalimuthu) to [nginx url rewriting: difference between break and last](https://serverfault.com/a/829148).</i></sup>

Official documentation has a great tutorials about [Creating NGINX Rewrite Rules](https://www.nginx.com/blog/creating-nginx-rewrite-rules/) and [Converting rewrite rules](https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/converting_rewrite_rules.html).

Finally, look at difference between `last` and `break` flags in action:

- `last` directive:

###### `return` directive

  > **:bookmark: [Use return directive for URL redirection (301, 302) - Base Rules - P2](RULES.md#beginner-use-return-directive-for-url-redirection-301-302)**<br>
  > **:bookmark: [Use return directive instead of rewrite for redirects - Performance - P2](RULES.md#beginner-use-return-directive-instead-of-rewrite-for-redirects)**

The other way is a `return` directive. It's faster than rewrite because there is no regexp that has to be evaluated. It's stops processing and returns HTTP 301 (by default) to a client, and the entire url is rerouted to the url specified.

I use `return` directive in the following cases:

- force redirect from http to https:

  ```nginx
  server {

    ...

    return  301 https://example.com$request_uri;

  }
  ```

- redirect from www to non-www and vice versa:

  ```nginx
  server {

    ...

    # It's only example. You shouldn't use 'if' statement in the following case.
    if ($host = www.example.com) {

      return  301 https://example.com$request_uri;

    }

  }
  ```

- close the connection and log it internally:

  ```nginx
  server {

    ...

    return 444;

  }
  ```

- send 4xx HTTP response for a client without any other actions:

  ```nginx
  server {

    ...

    if ($request_method = POST) {

      return 405;

    }

    # or:
    if ($invalid_referer) {

      return 403;

    }

    # or:
    if ($request_uri ~ "^/app/(.+)$") {

      return 403;

    }

    # or:
    location ~ ^/(data|storage) {

      return 403;

    }

  }
  ```

- and sometimes for reply with HTTP code without serving a file or response body:

  ```nginx
  server {

    ...

    # NGINX will not allow a 200 with no response body (200's need to be with a resource in the response.
    # '204 No Content' is meant to say "I've completed the request, but there is no body to return"):
    return 204 "it's all okay";
    # Or without body:
    return 204;

    # Because default Content-Type is application/octet-stream, browser will offer to "save the file".
    # If you want to see reply in browser you should add properly Content-Type:
    # add_header Content-Type text/plain;

  }
  ```

To the last example: be careful if you're using such a configuration to do a healthcheck. While a 204 HTTP code is semantically perfect for a healthcheck (success indication with no content), some services do not consider it a success.

##### `try_files` directive

We have one more very interesting and important directive: `try_files` (from the `ngx_http_core_module`). This directive tells NGINX to check for the existence of a named set of files or directories (checks files conditionally breaking on success).

I think the best explanation comes from the official documentation:

  > _`try_files` checks the existence of files in the specified order and uses the first found file for request processing; the processing is performed in the current context. The path to a file is constructed from the file parameter according to the root and alias directives. It is possible to check directoryâ€™s existence by specifying a slash at the end of a name, e.g. `$uri/`. If none of the files were found, an internal redirect to the uri specified in the last parameter is made._

Generally it may check files on disk, redirect to proxies or internal locations, and return error codes, all in one directive.

Take a look at the following example:

```nginx
server {

  ...

  root /var/www/example.com;

  location / {

    try_files $uri $uri/ /frontend/index.html;

  }

  location ^~ /images {

    root /var/www/static;
    try_files $uri $uri/ =404;

  }

  ...
```

- default root directory for all locations is `/var/www/example.com`

- `location /` - matches all locations without more specific locations, e.g. exact names

  - `try_files $uri` - when you receive a URI that's matched by this block try `$uri` first

    > For example: `https://example.com/tools/en.js` - NGINX will try to check if there's a file inside `/tools` called `en.js`, if found it, serve it in the first place.

  - `try_files $uri $uri/` - if you didn't find the first condition try the URI as a directory

    > For example: `https://example.com/backend/` - NGINX will try first check if a file called `backend` exists, if can't find it then goes to second check `$uri/` and see if there's a directory called `backend` exists then it will try serving it.

  - `try_files $uri $uri/ /frontend/index.html` - if a file and directory not found, NGINX sends `/frontend/index.html`

- `location ^~ /images` - handle any query beginning with `/images` and halts searching

  - default root directory for this location is `/var/www/static`

  - `try_files $uri` - when you receive a URI that's matched by this block try `$uri` first

    > For example: `https://example.com/images/01.gif` - NGINX will try to check if there's a file inside `/images` called `01.gif`, if found it, serve it in the first place.

  - `try_files $uri $uri/` - if you didn't find the first condition try the URI as a directory

    > For example: `https://example.com/images/` - NGINX will try first check if a file called `images` exists, if can't find it then goes to second check `$uri/` and see if there's a directory called `images` exists then it will try serving it.

  - `try_files $uri $uri/ =404` - if a file and directory not found, NGINX sends `HTTP 404` (Not Found)

On the other hand, `try_files` is relatively primitive. When encountered, NGINX will look for any of the specified files physically in the directory matched by the location block. If they donâ€™t exist, NGINX does an internal redirect to the last entry in the directive.

##### `if`, `break` and `set`

  > **:bookmark: [Avoid checks server_name with if directive - Performance - P2](RULES.md#beginner-avoid-checks-server_name-with-if-directive)**

The `ngx_http_rewrite_module` also provides additional directives:

- `break` - stops processing, if is specified inside the `location`, further processing of the request continues in this location:

  ```nginx
  # It's useful for:
  if ($slow_resp) {

    limit_rate 50k;
    break;

  }
  ```

- `if` - you can use `if` inside a `server` but not the other way around, also notice that you shouldn't use `if` inside `location` as it may not work as desired. For example, `if` statements aren't a good way of setting custom headers because they may cause statements outside the if block to be ignored. The NGINX docs says:

  > _There are cases where you simply cannot avoid using an `if`, for example if you need to test a variable which has no equivalent directive._

  You should also remember about this:

  > _The `if` context in NGINX is provided by the rewrite module and this is the primary intended use of this context. Since NGINX will test conditions of a request with many other purpose-made directives, `if` **should not** be used for most forms of conditional execution. This is such an important note that the NGINX community has created a page called [if is evil](https://www.nginx.com/resources/wiki/start/topics/depth/ifisevil/) (yes, it's really evil and in most cases not needed)._

- `set` - sets a value for the specified variable. The value can contain text, variables, and their combination

Example of usage `if` and `set` directives:

```nginx
# It comes from: https://gist.github.com/jrom/1760790:
if ($request_uri = /) {

  set $test  A;

}

if ($host ~* example.com) {

  set $test  "${test}B";

}

if ($http_cookie !~* "auth_token") {

  set $test  "${test}C";

}

if ($test = ABC) {

  proxy_pass http://cms.example.com;
  break;

}
```

##### `root` vs `alias`

  > Placing a `root` or `alias` directive in a location block overrides the `root` or `alias` directive that was applied at a higher scope.

With `alias` you can map to another file name. With `root` forces you to name your file on the server. In the first case, NGINX replaces the string prefix e.g `/robots.txt` in the URL path with e.g. `/var/www/static/robots.01.txt` and then uses the result as a filesystem path. In the second, NGINX inserts the string e.g. `/var/www/static/` at the beginning of the URL path and then uses the result as a file system path.

Look at this. There is a difference, when the `alias` is for a whole directory will work:

```nginx
location ^~ /data/ { alias /home/www/static/data/; }
```

But the following code won't do:

```nginx
location ^~ /data/ { root /home/www/static/data/; }
```

This would have to be:

```nginx
location ^~ /data/ { root /home/www/static/; }
```

The `root` directive is typically placed in server and location blocks. Placing a `root` directive in the server block makes the `root` directive available to all location blocks within the same server block.

This directive tells NGINX to take the request url and append it behind the specified directory. For example, with the following configuration block:

```nginx
server {

  server_name example.com;
  listen 10.250.250.10:80;

  index index.html;
  root /var/www/example.com;

  location / {

    try_files $uri $uri/ =404;

  }

  location ^~ /images {

    root /var/www/static;
    try_files $uri $uri/ =404;

  }

}
```

NGINX will map the request made to:

- `http://example.com/images/logo.png` into the file path `/var/www/static/images/logo.png`
- `http://example.com/contact.html` into the file path `/var/www/example.com/contact.html`
- `http://example.com/about/us.html` into the file path `/var/www/example.com/about/us.html`

Like you want to forward all requests which start `/static` and your data present in `/var/www/static` you should set:

- first path: `/var/www`
- last path: `/static`
- full path: `/var/www/static`

```nginx
location <last path> {

  root <first path>;

  ...

}
```

NGINX documentation on the `alias` directive suggests that it is better to use `root` over `alias` when the location matches the last part of the directiveâ€™s value.

The `alias` directive can only be placed in a location block. The following is a set of configurations for illustrating how the `alias` directive is applied:

```nginx
server {

  server_name example.com;
  listen 10.250.250.10:80;

  index index.html;
  root /var/www/example.com;

  location / {

    try_files $uri $uri/ =404;

  }

  location ^~ /images {

    alias /var/www/static;
    try_files $uri $uri/ =404;

  }

}
```

NGINX will map the request made to:

- `http://example.com/images/logo.png` into the file path `/var/www/static/logo.png`
- `http://example.com/images/ext/img.png` into the file path `/var/www/static/ext/img.png`
- `http://example.com/contact.html` into the file path `/var/www/example.com/contact.html`
- `http://example.com/about/us.html` into the file path `/var/www/example.com/about/us.html`

When location matches the last part of the directive's value it is better to use the root directive (it seems like an arbitrary style choice because authors don't justify that instruction at all). Look at this example from the official documentation:

```nginx
location /images/ {

  alias /data/w3/images/;

}

# Better solution:
location /images/ {

  root /data/w3;

}
```

##### `internal` directive

This directive specifies that the location block is internal. In other words,
the specified resource cannot be accessed by external requests.

On the other hand, it specifies how external redirections, i.e. locations like `http://example.com/app.php/some-path` should be handled; while set, they should return 404, only allowing internal redirections. In brief, this tells NGINX it's not accessible from the outside (it doesn't redirect anything).

Conditions handled as internal redirections are listed in the documentation for `internal` directive. Specifies that a given location can only be used for internal requests and are the following:

- requests redirected by the `error_page`, `index`, `random_index`, and `try_files` directives
- requests redirected by the `X-Accel-Redirect` response header field from an upstream server
- subrequests formed by the `include virtual` command of the `ngx_http_ssi_module module`, by the `ngx_http_addition_module` module directives, and by `auth_request` and `mirror` directives
- requests changed by the `rewrite` directive

Example 1:

```nginx
error_page 404 /404.html;

location = /404.html {

  internal;

}
```

Example 2:

The files are served from the directory `/srv/hidden-files` by the path prefix `/hidden-files/`. Pretty straightforward. The internal declaration tells NGINX that this path is accessible only through rewrites in the NGINX config, or via the `X-Accel-Redirect `header in proxied responses.

To use this, just return an empty response which contains that header. The content of the header should be the location you want to redirect to:

```nginx
location /hidden-files/ {

  internal;
  alias /srv/hidden-files/;

}
```

Example 3:

Another use case for internal redirects in NGINX is to hide credentials. Often you need to make requests to 3rd party services. For example, you want to send text messages or access a paid maps server. It would be the most efficient to send these requests directly from your JavaScript front end. However, doing so means you would have to embed an access token in the front end. This means savvy users could extract this token and make requests on your account.

An easy fix is to make an endpoint in your back end which initiates the actual request. We could make use of an HTTP client library inside the back end. However, this will again tie up workers, especially if you expect a barrage of requests and the 3rd party service is responding very slowly.

```nginx
location /external-api/ {

  internal;
  set $redirect_uri "$upstream_http_redirect_uri";
  set $authorization "$upstream_http_authorization";

  # For performance:
  proxy_buffering off;
  # Pass on secret from backend:
  proxy_set_header Authorization $authorization;
  # Use URI determined by backend:
  proxy_pass $redirect_uri;

}
```

<sup><i>Examples 2 and 3 (both are great!) comes from [How to use internal redirects in NGINX](https://clubhouse.io/developer-how-to/how-to-use-internal-redirects-in-nginx/).</i></sup>

  > There is a limit of 10 internal redirects per request to prevent request processing cycles that can occur in incorrect configurations. If this limit is reached, the error _HTTP 500 Internal Server Error_ is returned. In such cases, the `rewrite or internal redirection cycle` message can be seen in the error log.

Look also at [Authentication Based on Subrequest Result](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx/admin-guide/security-controls/configuring-subrequest-authentication/) from the official documentation.

##### External and internal redirects

External redirects originate directly from the client. So, if the client fetched `https://example.com/directory` it would be directly fall into preceding `location` block.

Internal redirect means that it doesnâ€™t send a 302 response to the client, it simply performs an implicit rewrite of the url and attempts to process it as though the user typed the new url originally.

The internal redirect is different from the external redirect defined by HTTP response code 302 and 301, client browser won't update its URI addresses.

To begin rewriting internally, we should explain the difference between redirects and internal rewrite. When source points to a destination that is out of source domain that is what we call redirect as your request will go from source to outside domain/destination.

With internal rewrite you would be, basically, doing the same only the destination is local path under same domain and not the outside location.

There is also [great explanation](https://openresty.org/download/agentzh-nginx-tutorials-en.html#02-nginxdirectiveexecorder06) about internal redirects:

  > _The internal redirection (e.g. via the `echo_exec` or `rewrite` directive) is an operation that makes NGINX jump from one location to another while processing a request (are very similar to `goto` statement in the C language). This "jumping" happens completely within the server itself._

There are two different kinds of internal requests:

- **internal redirects** - redirects the client requests internally. The URI is
changed, and the request may therefore match another location block and
become eligible for different settings. The most common case of internal
redirects is when using the `rewrite` directive, which allows you to rewrite the
request URI

- **sub-requests** - additional requests that are triggered internally to generate (insert or append to the body of the original request) content that is complementary to the main request (`addition` or `ssi` modules)

##### `allow` and `deny`

Both comes from the `ngx_http_access_module` module allows limiting access to certain client addresses. You can combining `allow/deny` rules.

The easiest path would be to start out by denying all access, then only granting access to those locations you want.

  > `deny` will always return 403 error code.

Putting `satisfy any;` in your configuration tells NGINX to accept either http authentication, or IP restriction. By default, when you define both, it will expect both.

Both directives may work unexpectedly! Look at the following example:

```nginx
server {

  server_name example.com;

  deny all;

  location = /test {
    return 200 "it's all okay";
    more_set_headers 'Content-Type: text/plain';
  }

}
```

If you generate a reqeust:

```bash
curl -i https://example.com
HTTP/2 200
date: Wed, 11 Nov 2018 10:02:45 GMT
content-length: 13
server: Unknown
content-type: text/plain

it's all okay
```

Why? Look at [Request processing stages](doc/NGINX_BASICS.md#request-processing-stages) chapter. That's because NGINX process request in phases, and `rewrite` phase (where `return` belongs) goes before `access` phase (where `deny` works).

##### `uri` vs `request_uri`

  > **:bookmark: [Use `$request_uri` to avoid using regular expressions - Performance - P2](RULES.md#beginner-use-request_uri-to-avoid-using-regular-expressions)**

`$request_uri` is the original request (for example, `/foo/bar.php?arg=baz` includes arguments and can't be modified) but `$uri` refers to the altered URI so `$uri` is not equivalent to `$request_uri`.

See [this](https://stackoverflow.com/a/48709976) great and short explanation by [Richard Smith](https://stackoverflow.com/users/4862445/richard-smith):

  > The `$uri` variable is set to the URI that NGINX is currently processing - but it is also subject to normalisation, including:
  >
  > - removal of the `?` and query string
  > - consecutive `/` characters are replace by a single `/`
  > - URL encoded characters are decoded
  >
  > The value of `$request_uri` is always the original URI and is not subject to any of the above normalisations.
  >
  > Most of the time you would use `$uri`, because it is normalised. Using `$request_uri` in the wrong place can cause URL encoded characters to become doubly encoded.

Both excludes the schema (`https://` and the port (implicit 443) in both examples above) as defined by [RFC2616](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616#section-3.2.2) <sup>[IETF]</sup> for the URL:

```
http_URL = "http(s):" "//" host [ ":" port ] [ abs_path [ "?" query ]]
```

Take a look at the following table:

| <b>URL</b> | <b><code>$request_uri</code></b> | <b><code>$uri</code></b> |
| :---         | :---         | :---         |
| `https://example.com/foo` | `/foo` | `/foo` |
| `https://example.com/foo/bar` | `/foo/bar` | `/foo/bar` |
| `https://example.com/foo/bar/` | `/foo/bar/` | `/foo/bar/` |
| `https://example.com/foo/bar?` | `/foo/bar?` | `/foo/bar` |
| `https://example.com/foo/bar?do=test` | `/foo/bar?do=test` | `/foo/bar` |
| `https://example.com/rfc2616-sec3.html#sec3.2` | `/rfc2616-sec3.html` | `/rfc2616-sec3.html` |

Remember:

  > Another way to repeat the location is to use the `proxy_pass` directive.

Which is quite easy:

```nginx
location /app/ {

  proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:5000;

  # or:
  proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/app/;

}
```

| <b>LOCATION</b> | <b><code>proxy_pass</code></b> | <b>REQUEST</b> | <b>RECEIVED BY UPSTREAM</b> |
| :---         | :---         | :---         | :---         |
| `/app/` | `http://localhost:5000/api$request_uri` | `/app/foo?bar=baz` | `/api/webapp/foo?bar=baz` |
| `/app/` | `http://localhost:5000/api$uri` | `/app/foo?bar=baz` | `/api/webapp/foo` |

#### Compression and decompression

  > **:bookmark: [Mitigation of CRIME/BREACH attacks - Hardening Rules - P2](RULES.md#beginner-mitigation-of-crimebreach-attacks)**

By default, NGINX compresses responses only with MIME type text/html using the `gzip` method. So, if you send request with `Accept-Encoding: gzip` header you will not see the `Content-Encoding: gzip` in the response.

To enable `gzip` compression:

```nginx
gzip on;
```

To compress responses with other MIME types, include the `gzip_types` directive and list the additional types:

```nginx
gzip_types text/plain text/css text/xml text/javascript application/x-javascript application/xml;
```

  > Remember: by default, NGINX doesn't compress image files using its per-request gzip module.

I also highly recommend you read this (it's interesting observation about gzip and performance by [Barry Pollard](https://serverfault.com/users/268936/barry-pollard)):

  > _To be honest gzip is not very processor intensive these days and gzipping on the fly (and then unzipping in the browser) is often the norm. Itâ€™s something web browsers are very good at._
  >
  > _So unless you are getting huge volumes of traffic youâ€™ll probably not notice any performance or CPU load impact due to on the fly gzipping for most web files._

To test HTTP and Gzip compression I recommend two external tools:

- [HTTP Compression Test](https://www.whatsmyip.org/http-compression-test/)
- [HTTP Gzip Compression Test](http://www.visiospark.com/gzip-compression-test/)

NGINX also compress large files and avoid the temptation to compress smaller files (such as images, executables, etc.), because very small files barely benefit from compression. You can tell NGINX not to compress files smaller than e.g. 128 bytes:

```nginx
gzip_min_length 128;
```

For more information see [Finding the Nginx gzip_comp_level Sweet Spot](https://mjanja.ch/2015/03/finding-the-nginx-gzip_comp_level-sweet-spot/).

NGINX also provides static compression with static module. It is better, for 2 reasons:

- you don't have to gzip for each request
- you can use a higher gzip level

For example:

```nginx
# Enable static gzip compression:
location ^~ /assets/ {

  gzip_static on;

  ...

}
```

You should put the `gzip_static on;` inside the blocks that configure static files, but if youâ€™re only running one site, itâ€™s safe to just put it in the http block.

So, for example, to service a request for `/foo/bar/file`, NGINX tries to find and send the file `/foo/bar/file.gz`.

##### What is the best NGINX compression gzip level?

The level of gzip compression simply determines how compressed the data is on a scale from 1-9, where 9 is the most compressed. The trade-off is that the most compressed data usually requires the most work to compress/decompress but look also at [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/28452429/does-gzip-compression-level-have-any-impact-on-decompression/37892065#37892065) great answer. Author explains that the level of gzip compression doesn't affect the difficulty to decompress.

I think the ideal compression level seems to be between 4 and 6. The following directive set how much files will be compressed:

```nginx
gzip_comp_level 6;
```

#### Hash tables

  > Before start reading this chapter I recommend [Hash tables explained](https://yourbasic.org/algorithms/hash-tables-explained/).

To assist with the rapid processing of requests, NGINX uses hash tables. NGINX hash, though in principle is same as typical hash lists, but it has significant differences.

They are not meant for applications that add and remove elements dynamicall but are specifically designed to hold set of init time elements arranged in hash list. All elements that are put in the hash list are known while creating the hash list itself. No dynamic addtion or deletion is possible here.

This hash table is constructed and compiled during restart or reload and afterwards it's running very fast. Main purpose seems to be speeding up the lookup of one time added elements.

Look at the [Setting up hashes](http://nginx.org/en/docs/hash.html) from official documentation:

  > _To quickly process static sets of data such as server names, map directiveâ€™s values, MIME types, names of request header strings, NGINX uses hash tables. During the start and each re-configuration NGINX selects the minimum possible sizes of hash tables such that the bucket size that stores keys with identical hash values does not exceed the configured parameter (hash bucket size). The size of a table is expressed in buckets. The adjustment is continued until the table size exceeds the hash max size parameter. Most hashes have the corresponding directives that allow changing these parameters._

I also recommend [Optimizations](https://www.nginx.com/resources/wiki/start/topics/tutorials/optimizations/) section and [nginx - Hashing scheme](http://netsecinfo.blogspot.com/2010/01/nginx-hashing-scheme.html) explanation.

Some important information (based on [this](https://serverfault.com/questions/419847/nginx-setting-server-names-hash-max-size-and-server-names-hash-bucket-size/786726#786726) amazing research by [brablc](https://serverfault.com/users/94256/brablc)):

- the general recommendation would be to keep both values as small as possible and as less collisions as possible (during startup and with each reconfiguration, NGINX selects the smallest possible size for the hash tables)

- it depends on your setup, you can reduce the number of server from the table and `reload` the NGINX instead of `restart`

- if NGINX gave out communication about the need for increasing `hash_max_size` or `hash_bucket_size`, then it is first necessary to increase the first parameter

- bigger `hash_max_size` uses more memory, bigger `hash_bucket_size` uses more CPU cycles during lookup and more transfers from main memory to cache. If you have enough memory increase `hash_max_size` and try to keep `hash_bucket_size` as low as possible

- each hash table entry consumes space in a bucket. The space required is the length of the key (with some overhead to store the domainâ€™s actual length as well), e.g. domain name

  > Since `stage.api.example.com` is 21 characters, all entries consume at least 24 bytes in a bucket, and most consume 32 bytes or more.

- as you increase the number of entries, you have to increase the size of the hash table and/or the number of hash buckets in the table

  > If NGINX complains increase `hash_max_size` first as long as it complains. If the number exceeds some big number (32769 for instance), increase `hash_bucket_size` to multiple of default value on your platform as long as it complains. If it does not complain anymore, decrease `hash_max_size` back as long as it does not complain. Now you have the best setup for your set of server names (each set of server names may need different setup).

- with a hash bucket size of 64 or 128, a bucket is full after 4 or 5 entries hash to it

- `hash_max_size` is not related to number of server names directly, if number of servers doubles, you may need to increase `hash_max_size` 10 times or even more to avoid collisions. If you cannot avoid them, you have to increase `hash_bucket_size`

- if you have `hash_max_size` less than 10000 and small `hash_bucket_size`, you can expect long loading time because NGINX would try to find optimal hash size in a loop (see [src/core/ngx_hash.c](https://github.com/nginx/nginx/blob/c3aed0a23392a509f64b740064f5f6633e8c89d8/src/core/ngx_hash.c#L289))

- if you have `hash_max_size` bigger than 10000, there will be only 1000 loops performed before it would complain

##### Server names hash table

The hash with the names of servers are controlled by the following directives (inside `http` context):

- `server_names_hash_max_size` - sets the maximum size of the server names hash tables; default value: 512
- `server_names_hash_bucket_size` - sets the bucket size for the server names hash tables; default values: 32, 64, or 128 (the default value depends on the size of the processorâ€™s cache line)

  > Parameter `server_names_hash_bucket_size` is always equalized to the size, multiple to the size of the line of processor cache.

If server name is defined as `too.long.server.name.example.com` then NGINX will fail to start and display the error message like:

```
nginx: [emerg] could not build server_names_hash, you should increase server_names_hash_bucket_size: 64
```

To fix this, you should `reload` the NGINX or increase the `server_names_hash_bucket_size` directive value to the next power of two (in this case to 128).

If a large number of server names are defined, and NGINX complained with the following error:

```
nginx: [emerg] could not build the server_names_hash, you should increase either server_names_hash_max_size: 512 or server_names_hash_bucket_size: 32
```

Try to set the `server_names_hash_max_size` to a number close to the number of server names. Only if this does not help, or if NGINX's start time is unacceptably long, try to increase the `server_names_hash_bucket_size` parameter.

#### Log files

  > **:bookmark: [Use custom log formats - Debugging - P4](RULES.md#beginner-use-custom-log-formats)**

Log files are a critical part of the NGINX management. It writes information about client requests in the access log right after the request is processed (in the last phase: `NGX_HTTP_LOG_PHASE`).

By default:

- the access log is located in `logs/access.log`, but I suggest you take it to `/var/log/nginx` directory
- data is written in the predefined `combined/main` format

It is the equivalent to the following configuration:

```nginx
# In nginx.conf (default log format):
http {

  ...

  log_format main
                  '$remote_addr - $remote_user [$time_local] "$request" '
                  '$status $body_bytes_sent "$http_referer" '
                  '"$http_user_agent" "$http_x_forwarded_for"';

  # but I suggest you change:
  log_format main
                  '$remote_addr - $remote_user [$time_local] '
                  '"$request_method $scheme://$host$request_uri '
                  '$server_protocol" $status $body_bytes_sent '
                  '"$http_referer" "$http_user_agent" '
                  '$request_time';

}
```

For more information please see [Configuring Logging](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx/admin-guide/monitoring/logging/).

  > If you don't want 404 errors to show in your NGINX error logs, you should set `log_not_found off;`.

  > If you want to enable logging of subrequests into `access_log`, you should set `log_subrequest on;` and change the default logging format (you have to log `$uri` to see the difference). There is [great explanation](https://serverfault.com/questions/904396/how-to-identify-subrequests-in-nginx-log-files/922956#922956) about how to identify subrequests in NGINX log files.

I also recommend to read:

- [ngx_http_log_module](http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_log_module.html)
- [ngx_http_upstream_module](http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_upstream_module.html)

##### Conditional logging

Sometimes certain entries are there just to fill up the logs or are cluttering them. I sometimes exclude requests - by client IP or whatever else - when I want to debug log files more effective.

So, in this example, if the `$error_codes` variableâ€™s value is 0 - then log nothing (default action), but if 1 (e.g. `404` or `503` from backend) - to save this request to the log:

```nginx
# Define map in the http context:
http {

  ...

  map $status $error_codes {

    default   1;
    ~^[23]    0;

  }

  ...

  # Add if condition to the access log:
  access_log /var/log/nginx/example.com-access.log combined if=$error_codes;

}
```

##### Manually log rotation

  > **:bookmark: [Configure log rotation policy - Base Rules - P1](RULES.md#beginner-configure-log-rotation-policy)**

NGINX will re-open its logs in response to the `USR1` signal:

```bash
cd /var/log/nginx

mv access.log access.log.0
kill -USR1 $(cat /var/run/nginx.pid) && sleep 1

# >= gzip-1.6:
gzip -k access.log.0
# With any version:
gzip < access.log.0 > access.log.0.gz

# Test integrity and remove if test passed:
gzip -t access.log.0 && rm -fr access.log.0
```

##### Error log severity levels

  > You can't specify your own format, but in NGINX build-in several level's of `error_log`-ing.

The following is a list of all severity levels:

| <b>TYPE</b> | <b>DESCRIPTION</b> |
| :---         | :---         |
| `debug` | information that can be useful to pinpoint where a problem is occurring |
| `info` | informational messages that arenâ€™t necessary to read but may be good to know |
| `notice` | something normal happened that is worth noting |
| `warn` | something unexpected happened, however is not a cause for concern |
| `error` | something was unsuccessful, contains the action of limiting rules |
| `crit` | important problems that need to be addressed |
| `alert` | severe situation where action is needed promptly |
| `emerg` | the system is in an unusable state and requires immediate attention |

For example: if you set `crit` error log level, messages of `crit`, `alert`, and `emerg` levels are logged.

  > For debug logging to work, NGINX needs to be built with `--with-debug`.

Default values for the error level:

- in the main section - `error`
- in the HTTP section - `crit`

#### How to log the start time of a request?

The most logging information requires the request to complete (status code, bytes sent, durations, etc). If you want to log the start time of a request in NGINX you should apply a [patch](https://gist.github.com/rkbodenner/318681) that exposes request start time as a variable.

The `$time_local` variable contains the time when the log entry is written so when the HTTP request header is read, NGINX does a lookup of the associated virtual server configuration. If the virtual server is found, the request goes through six phases:

- server rewrite phase
- location phase
- location rewrite phase (which can bring the request back to the previous phase)
- access control phase
- `try_files` phase
- log phase

Since the log phase is the last one, `$time_local` variable is much more colse to the end of the request than it's start.

#### How to log the HTTP request body?

Nginx doesn't parse the client request body unless it really needs to, so it usually does not fill the `$request_body` variable.

The exceptions are when:

- it sends the request to a proxy
- or a fastcgi server

So you really need to either add the `proxy_pass` or `fastcgi_pass` directives to your block.

```nginx
# 1) Set log format:
log_format req_body_logging '$remote_addr - $remote_user [$time_local] '
                            '"$request" $status $body_bytes_sent '
                            '"$http_referer" "$http_user_agent" "$request_body"';

# 2) Limit the request body size:
client_max_body_size 1k;
client_body_buffer_size 1k;
client_body_in_single_buffer on;

# 3) Put the log format:
server {

  ...

  location /api/v4 {

    access_log    logs/access_req_body.log req_body_logging;
    proxy_pass    http://127.0.0.1;

    ...

  }

  location = /post.php {

    access_log    /var/log/nginx/postdata.log req_body_logging;
    fastcgi_pass  php_cgi;

    ...

  }

}
```

For this, you can also use [echo](https://github.com/openresty/echo-nginx-module) module. To log a request body, what we need is to use the `echo_read_request_body` command and the `$request_body` variable (contains the request body of the echo module).

  > `echo_read_request_body` explicitly reads request body so that the `$request_body` variable will always have non-empty values (unless the body is so big that it has been saved by NGINX to a local temporary file).

```nginx
http {

  log_format req_body_logging '$request_body';
  access_log /var/log/nginx/access.log req_body_logging;

  ...

  server {

    location / {

      echo_read_request_body;

      ...

    }

    ...

  }

}
```

#### Reverse proxy

  > After reading this chapter, please see: [Rules: Reverse Proxy](RULES.md#reverse-proxy).

This is one of the greatest feature of the NGINX. In simplest terms, a reverse proxy is a server that comes in-between internal applications and external clients, forwarding client requests to the appropriate server. It takes a client request, passes it on to one or more servers, and subsequently delivers the serverâ€™s response back to the client.

Official NGINX documentation says:

  > _Proxying is typically used to distribute the load among several servers, seamlessly show content from different websites, or pass requests for processing to application servers over protocols other than HTTP._

You can also read a very good explanation about [What's the difference between proxy server and reverse proxy server](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/224664/whats-the-difference-between-proxy-server-and-reverse-proxy-server/366212#366212).

A reverse proxy can off load much of the infrastructure concerns of a high-volume distributed web application.

</p>

<sup><i>This infographic comes from [Jenkins with NGINX - Reverse proxy with https](https://medium.com/@sportans300/nginx-reverse-proxy-with-https-466daa4da4fc).</i></sup>

This allow you to have NGINX reverse proxy requests to unicorns, mongrels, webricks, thins, or whatever you really want to have run your servers.

Reverse proxy gives you number of advanced features such as:

- load balancing, failover, and transparent maintenance of the backend servers
- increased security (e.g. SSL termination, hide upstream configuration)
- increased performance (e.g. caching, load balancing)
- simplifies the access control responsibilities (single point of access and maintenance)
- centralised logging and auditing (single point of maintenance)
- add/remove/modify HTTP headers

In my opinion, the two most important things related to the reverse proxy are:

- the way of requests forwarded to the backend
- the type of headers forwarded to the backend

If we talking about security of the proxy server look at this recommendations of the National Institute of Standards and Technology about [Guidelines on Securing Public Web Servers](https://www.nist.gov/publications/guidelines-securing-public-web-servers). This document is a good starting point. Is old but still has interesting solutions and suggestions.

There is a [great explanation](https://serverfault.com/a/25095) about the benefits of improving security through the use of a reverse proxy server.

  > A reverse proxy gives you a couple things that may make your server more secure:
  >
  > - a place to monitor and log what is going on separate from the web server
  > - a place to filter separate from your web server if you know that some area of your system is vulnerable. Depending on the proxy you may be able to filter at the application level
  > - another place to implement ACLs and rules if you cannot be expressive enough for some reason on your web server
  > - a separate network stack that will not be vulnerable in the same ways as your web server. This is particularly true if your proxy is from a different vendor
  > - a reverse proxy with no filtering does not automatically protect you against everything, but if the system you need to protect is high-value then adding a reverse proxy may be worth the costs support and performance costs

Another [great answer](https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/48347/documented-best-practices-for-reverse-proxy-implementation) about best practices for reverse proxy implementation:

  > In my experience some of the most important requirements and mitigations, in no particular order, are:
  >
  > - make sure that your proxy, back-end web (and DB) servers cannot establish direct outbound (internet) connections (including DNS and SMTP, and particularly HTTP). This means (forward) proxies/relays for required outbound access, if required
  > - make sure your logging is useful (Â§9.1 in the above), and coherent. You may have logs from multiple devices (router, firewall/IPS/WAF, proxy, web/app servers, DB servers). If you can't quickly, reliably and deterministically link records across each device together, you're doing it wrong. This means NTP, and logging any or all of: PIDs, TIDs, session-IDs, ports, headers, cookies, usernames, IP addresses and maybe more (and may mean some logs contain confidential information)
  > - understand the protocols, and make deliberate, informed decisions: including cipher/TLS version choice, HTTP header sizes, URL lengths, cookies. Limits should be implemented on the reverse-proxy. If you're migrating to a tiered architecture, make sure the dev team are in the loop so that problems are caught as early as possible
  > - run vulnerability scans from the outside, or get someone to do it for you. Make sure you know your footprint and that the reports highlight deltas, as well as the theoretical TLS SNAFU du-jour
  > - understand the modes of failure. Sending users a bare default "HTTP 500 - the wheels came off" when you have load or stability problems is sloppy
  > - monitoring, metrics and graphs: having normal and historic data is invaluable when investigating anomalies, and for capacity planning
  > - tuning: from TCP time-wait to listen backlog to SYN-cookies, again you need to make make deliberate, informed decisions
  > - follow basic OS hardening guidelines, consider the use of chroot/jails, host-based IDS, and other measures, where available

##### Passing requests

  > **:bookmark: [Use pass directive compatible with backend protocol - Reverse Proxy - P1](RULES.md#beginner-use-pass-directive-compatible-with-backend-protocol)**

When NGINX proxies a request, it sends the request to a specified proxied server, fetches the response, and sends it back to the client.

It is possible to proxy requests to:

- an HTTP servers (e.g. NGINX, Apache, or other) with `proxy_pass` directive:

  ```nginx
  upstream bk_front {

    server 192.168.252.20:8080  weight=5;
    server 192.168.252.21:8080

  }

  server {

    location / {

      proxy_pass    http://bk_front;

    }

    location /api {

      proxy_pass    http://192.168.21.20:8080;

    }

    location /info {

      proxy_pass    http://localhost:3000;

    }

    location /ra-client {

      proxy_pass    http://10.0.11.12:8080/guacamole/;

    }

    location /foo/bar/ {

      proxy_pass    http://www.example.com/url/;

    }

    ...

  }
  ```

- a non-HTTP servers (e.g. PHP, Node.js, Python, Java, or other) with `proxy_pass` directive (as a fallback) or directives specially designed for this:

  - `fastcgi_pass` which passes a request to a FastCGI server ([PHP FastCGI Example](https://www.nginx.com/resources/wiki/start/topics/examples/phpfcgi/)):

    ```nginx
    server {

      ...

      location ~ ^/.+\.php(/|$) {

        fastcgi_pass    127.0.0.1:9000;
        include         /etc/nginx/fcgi_params;

      }

      ...

    }
    ```

  - `uwsgi_pass` which passes a request to a uWSGI server ([Nginx support uWSGI](https://uwsgi-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Nginx.html)):

    ```nginx
    server {

      location / {

        root            html;
        uwsgi_pass      django_cluster;
        uwsgi_param     UWSGI_SCRIPT testapp;
        include         /etc/nginx/uwsgi_params;

      }

      ...

    }
    ```

  - `scgi_pass` which passes a request to an SCGI server:

    ```nginx
    server {

      location / {

        scgi_pass       127.0.0.1:4000;
        include         /etc/nginx/scgi_params;

      }

      ...

    }
    ```

  - `memcached_pass` which passes a request to a Memcached server:

    ```nginx
    server {

      location / {

        set            $memcached_key "$uri?$args";
        memcached_pass memc_instance:4004;

        error_page     404 502 504 = @memc_fallback;

      }

      location @memc_fallback {

        proxy_pass     http://backend;

      }

      ...

    }
    ```

  - `redis_pass` which passes a request to a Redis server ([HTTP Redis](https://www.nginx.com/resources/wiki/modules/redis/)):

    ```nginx
    server {

      location / {

        set            $redis_key $uri;

        redis_pass     redis_instance:6379;
        default_type   text/html;
        error_page     404 = /fallback;

      }

      location @fallback {

        proxy_pass     http://backend;

      }

      ...

    }
    ```

The `proxy_pass` and other `*_pass` directives specifies that all requests which match the location block should be forwarded to the specific socket, where the backend app is running.

However, more complex apps may need additional directives:

  - `proxy_pass` - see [`ngx_http_proxy_module`](http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_proxy_module.html) directives explanation
  - `fastcgi_pass` - see [`ngx_http_fastcgi_module`](http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_fastcgi_module.html) directives explanation
  - `uwsgi_pass` - see [`ngx_http_uwsgi_module`](http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_uwsgi_module.html) directives explanation
  - `scgi_pass` - see [`ngx_http_scgi_module`](http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_scgi_module.html) directives explanation
  - `memcached_pass` - see [`ngx_http_memcached_module`](http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_memcached_module.html) directives explanation
  - `redis_pass` - see [`ngx_http_redis_module`](https://www.nginx.com/resources/wiki/modules/redis/) directives explanation

##### Trailing slashes

  > **:bookmark: [Be careful with trailing slashes in proxy_pass directive - Reverse Proxy - P3](RULES.md#beginner-be-careful-with-trailing-slashes-in-proxy_pass-directive)**

If you have something like:

```nginx
location /public/ {

  proxy_pass http://bck_testing_01;

}
```

and go to `http://example.com/public`, NGINX will automatically redirect you to `http://example.com/public/`.

Look also at this example:

```nginx
location /foo/bar/ {

  # proxy_pass  http://example.com/url/;
  proxy_pass    http://192.168.100.20/url/;

}
```

If the URI is specified along with the address, it replaces the part of the request URI that matches the location parameter. For example, here the request with the `/foo/bar/page.html` URI will be proxied to `http://www.example.com/url/page.html`.

If the address is specified without a URI, or it is not possible to determine the part of URI to be replaced, the full request URI is passed (possibly, modified).

Look also at this. Here is an example with trailing slash in location, but no trailig slash in `proxy_pass`:

```nginx
location /foo/ {

  proxy_pass  http://127.0.0.1:8080/bar;

}
```

See how `bar` and `path` concatenates. If one go to address `http://yourserver.com/foo/path/id?param=1` NGINX will proxy request to `http://127.0.0.1/barpath/id?param=1`.

As stated in NGINX documentation if `proxy_pass` used without URI (i.e. without path after `server:port`) NGINX will put URI from original request exactly as it was with all double slashes, `../` and so on.

Look also at the configuration snippets: [Using trailing slashes](#using-trailing-slashes).

Below are additional examples:

| <b>LOCATION</b> | <b>PROXY_PASS</b> | <b>REQUEST</b> | <b>RECEIVED BY UPSTREAM</b> |
| :---         | :---         | :---         | :---         |
| `/app/` | `http://localhost:5000/api/` | `/app/foo?bar=baz` | `/api/foo?bar=baz` |
| `/app/` | `http://localhost:5000/api` | `/app/foo?bar=baz` | `/apifoo?bar=baz` |
| `/app` | `http://localhost:5000/api/` | `/app/foo?bar=baz` | `/api//foo?bar=baz` |
| `/app` | `http://localhost:5000/api` | `/app/foo?bar=baz` | `/api/foo?bar=baz` |
| `/app` | `http://localhost:5000/api` | `/appfoo?bar=baz` | `/apifoo?bar=baz` |

In other words:

  > You usually always want a trailing slash, never want to mix with and without trailing slash, and only want without trailing slash when you want to concatenate a certain path component together (which I guess is quite rarely the case). Note how query parameters are preserved.

##### Passing headers to the backend

  > **:bookmark: [Set the HTTP headers with add_header and proxy_*_header directives properly - Base Rules - P1](RULES.md#beginner-set-the-http-headers-with-add_header-and-proxy__header-directives-properly)**<br>
  > **:bookmark: [Remove support for legacy and risky HTTP headers - Hardening - P1](RULES.md#beginner-remove-support-for-legacy-and-risky-http-headers)**<br>
  > **:bookmark: [Always pass Host, X-Real-IP, and X-Forwarded headers to the backend - Reverse Proxy - P2](RULES.md#beginner-always-pass-host-x-real-ip-and-x-forwarded-headers-to-the-backend)**<br>
  > **:bookmark: [Use custom headers without X- prefix - Reverse Proxy - P3](RULES.md#beginner-use-reload-option-to-change-configurations-on-the-fly)**

By default, NGINX redefines two header fields in proxied requests:

- the `Host` header is re-written to the value defined by the `$proxy_host` variable. This will be the IP address or name and port number of the upstream, directly as defined by the `proxy_pass` directive

- the `Connection` header is changed to `close`. This header is used to signal information about the particular connection established between two parties. In this instance, NGINX sets this to `close` to indicate to the upstream server that this connection will be closed once the original request is responded to. The upstream should not expect this connection to be persistent

When NGINX proxies a request, it automatically makes some adjustments to the request headers it receives from the client:

- NGINX drop empty headers. There is no point of passing along empty values to another server; it would only serve to bloat the request

- NGINX, by default, will consider any header that contains underscores as invalid. It will remove these from the proxied request. If you wish to have NGINX interpret these as valid, you can set the `underscores_in_headers` directive to `on`, otherwise your headers will never make it to the backend server

It is important to pass more than just the URI if you expect the upstream server handle the request properly. The request coming from NGINX on behalf of a client will look different than a request coming directly from a client.

  > Please read [Managing request headers](https://www.nginx.com/resources/wiki/start/topics/examples/headers_management/) from the official wiki.

Use the `proxy_set_header` directive to sets headers that sends to the backend servers.

  > HTTP headers are used to transmit additional information between client and server. `add_header` sends headers to the client (browser) and will work on successful requests only, unless you set up `always` parameter. `proxy_set_header` sends headers to the backend server. If the value of a header field is an empty string then this field will not be passed to a proxied server.

It's also important to distinguish between request headers and response headers. Request headers are for traffic inbound to the webserver or backend app. Response headers are going the other way (in the HTTP response you get back using client, e.g. curl or browser).

Ok, so look at the following short explanation about proxy directives (for more information about valid header values please see [this](RULES.md#beginner-always-pass-host-x-real-ip-and-x-forwarded-stack-headers-to-the-backend) rule):

- `proxy_http_version` - defines the HTTP protocol version for proxying, by default it it set to 1.0. For Websockets and keepalive connections you need to use the version 1.1:

  ```nginx
  proxy_http_version  1.1;
  ```

- `proxy_cache_bypass` - sets conditions under which the response will not be taken from a cache:

  ```nginx
  proxy_cache_bypass  $http_upgrade;
  ```

- `proxy_intercept_errors` - means that any response with HTTP code 300 or greater is handled by the `error_page` directive and ensures that if the proxied backend returns an error status, NGINX will be the one showing the error page (as opposed to the error page on the backend side):

  ```nginx
  proxy_intercept_errors on;
  error_page 500 503 504 @debug;  # go to the @debug location
  ```

- `proxy_set_header` - allows redefining or appending fields to the request header passed to the proxied server

  - `Upgrade` and `Connection` - these header fields are required if your application is using Websockets:

    ```nginx
    proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
    proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";
    ```

  - `Host` - the `$host` variable in the following order of precedence contains: host name from the request line, or host name from the Host request header field, or the server name matching a request: NGINX uses `Host` header for `server_name` matching. It does not use TLS SNI. This means that for an SSL server, NGINX must be able to accept SSL connection, which boils down to having certificate/key. The cert/key can be any, e.g. self-signed:

    ```nginx
    proxy_set_header Host $host;
    ```

  - `X-Real-IP` - forwards the real visitor remote IP address to the proxied server:

    ```nginx
    proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
    ```

  - `X-Forwarded-For` - is the conventional way of identifying the originating IP address of the user connecting to the web server coming from either a HTTP proxy or load balancer:

    ```nginx
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
    ```

  - `X-Forwarded-Proto` - identifies the protocol (HTTP or HTTPS) that a client used to connect to your proxy or load balancer:

    ```nginx
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
    ```

  - `X-Forwarded-Host` - defines the original host requested by the client:

    ```nginx
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Host $host;
    ```

  - `X-Forwarded-Port` - defines the original port requested by the client:

    ```nginx
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Port $server_port;
    ```

If you want to read about custom headers, take a look at [Why we need to deprecate x prefix for HTTP headers?](https://tonyxu.io/posts/2018/http-deprecate-x-prefix/) and [this](https://stackoverflow.com/a/3561399) great answer by [BalusC](https://stackoverflow.com/users/157882/balusc).

###### Importance of the `Host` header

  > **:bookmark: [Set and pass Host header only with $host variable - Reverse Proxy - P2](RULES.md#beginner-set-and-pass-host-header-only-with-host-variable)**

The `Host` header tells the webserver which virtual host to use (if set up). You can even have the same virtual host using several aliases (domains and wildcard-domains). This why the host header exists. The host header specifies which website or web application should process an incoming HTTP request.

In NGINX, `$host` equals `$http_host`, lowercase and without the port number (if present), except when `HTTP_HOST` is absent or is an empty value. In that case, `$host` equals the value of the `server_name` directive of the server which processed the request.

But look at this:

  > _An unchanged `Host` request header field can be passed with `$http_host`. However, if this field is not present in a client request header then nothing will be passed. In such a case it is better to use the `$host` variable - its value equals the server name in the `Host` request header field or the primary server name if this field is not present._

For example, if you set `Host: MASTER:8080`, `$host` will be "master" (while `$http_host` will be `MASTER:8080` as it just reflects the whole header).

Look also at [$10k host header](https://www.ezequiel.tech/p/10k-host-header.html) and [What is a Host Header Attack?](https://www.acunetix.com/blog/articles/automated-detection-of-host-header-attacks/).

###### Redirects and `X-Forwarded-Proto`

  > **:bookmark: [Don't use X-Forwarded-Proto with $scheme behind reverse proxy - Reverse Proxy - P1](RULES.md#beginner-dont-use-x-forwarded-proto-with-scheme-behind-reverse-proxy)**

This header is very important because it prevent a redirect loop. When used inside HTTPS server block each HTTP response from the proxied server will be rewritten to HTTPS. Look at the following example:

1. Client sends the HTTP request to the Proxy
2. Proxy sends the HTTP request to the Server
3. Server sees that the URL is `http://`
4. Server sends back 3xx redirect response telling the Client to connect to `https://`
5. Client sends an HTTPS request to the Proxy
6. Proxy decrypts the HTTPS traffic and sets the `X-Forwarded-Proto: https`
7. Proxy sends the HTTP request to the Server
8. Server sees that the URL is `http://` but also sees that `X-Forwarded-Proto` is https and trusts that the request is HTTPS
9. Server sends back the requested web page or data

<sup><i>This explanation comes from [Purpose of the X-Forwarded-Proto HTTP Header](https://community.pivotal.io/s/article/Purpose-of-the-X-Forwarded-Proto-HTTP-Header).</i></sup>

In step 6 above, the Proxy is setting the HTTP header `X-Forwarded-Proto: https` to specify that the traffic it received is HTTPS. In step 8, the Server then uses the `X-Forwarded-Proto` to determine if the request was HTTP or HTTPS.

You can read about how to set it up correctly here:

- [Set correct scheme passed in X-Forwarded-Proto](RULES.md#set-correct-scheme-passed-in-x-forwarded-proto)
- [Don't use X-Forwarded-Proto with $scheme behind reverse proxy](RULES.md#beginner-dont-use-x-forwarded-proto-with-scheme-behind-reverse-proxy)

###### A warning about the `X-Forwarded-For`

  > **:bookmark: [Set properly values of the X-Forwarded-For header - Reverse Proxy - P1](RULES.md#beginner-set-properly-values-of-the-x-forwarded-for-header)**

I think we should just maybe stop for a second. `X-Forwarded-For` is a one of the most important header that has the security implications.

Where a connection passes through a chain of proxy servers, `X-Forwarded-For` can give a comma-separated list of IP addresses with the first being the furthest downstream (that is, the user).

`X-Forwarded-For` should not be used for any Access Control List (ACL) checks because it can be spoofed by attackers. Use the real IP address for this type of restrictions. HTTP request headers such as `X-Forwarded-For`, `True-Client-IP`, and `X-Real-IP` are not a robust foundation on which to build any security measures, such as access controls.

[Set properly values of the X-Forwarded-For header (from this handbook)](RULES.md#beginner-set-properly-values-of-the-x-forwarded-for-header) - see this for more detailed information on how to set properly values of the `X-Forwarded-For` header.

But that's not all. Behind a reverse proxy, the user IP we get is often the reverse proxy IP itself. If you use other HTTP server working between proxy and app server you should also set the correct mechanism for interpreting values of this header.

I recommend to read [this](https://serverfault.com/questions/314574/nginx-real-ip-header-and-x-forwarded-for-seems-wrong/414166#414166) amazing explanation by [Nick M](https://serverfault.com/users/130923/nick-m).

1) Pass headers from proxy to the backend layer

    - [Always pass Host, X-Real-IP, and X-Forwarded headers to the backend](RULES.md#beginner-always-pass-host-x-real-ip-and-x-forwarded-headers-to-the-backend)
    - [Set properly values of the X-Forwarded-For header (from this handbook)](RULES.md#beginner-set-properly-values-of-the-x-forwarded-for-header)

2) NGINX - modify the `set_real_ip_from` and `real_ip_header` directives:

    > For this, the `http_realip_module` must be installed (`--with-http_realip_module`).

    First of all, you should add the following lines to the configuration:

    ```nginx
    # Add these to the set_real_ip.conf, there are the real IPs where your traffic
    # is coming from (front proxy/lb):
    set_real_ip_from    192.168.20.10; # IP address of master
    set_real_ip_from    192.168.20.11; # IP address of slave

    # You can also add an entire subnet:
    set_real_ip_from    192.168.40.0/24;

    # Defines a request header field used to send the address for a replacement,
    # in this case We use X-Forwarded-For:
    real_ip_header      X-Forwarded-For;

    # The real IP from your client address that matches one of the trusted addresses
    # is replaced by the last non-trusted address sent in the request header field:
    real_ip_recursive   on;

    # Include it to the appropriate context:
    server {

      include /etc/nginx/set_real_ip.conf;

      ...

    }
    ```

3) NGINX - add/modify and set log format:

    ```nginx
    log_format combined-1 '$remote_addr forwarded for $http_x_real_ip - $remote_user [$time_local]  '
                          '"$request" $status $body_bytes_sent '
                          '"$http_referer" "$http_user_agent"';

    # or:
    log_format combined-2 '$remote_addr - $remote_user [$time_local] "$request" '
                          '$status $body_bytes_sent "$http_referer" '
                          '"$http_user_agent" "$http_x_forwarded_for"';

    access_log /var/log/nginx/example.com/access.log combined-1;
    ```

    This way, e.g. the `$_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR']` will be correctly filled up in PHP fastcgi. You can test it with the following script:

    ```php
    # tls_check.php
    <?php

    echo '<pre>';
    print_r($_SERVER);
    echo '</pre>';
    exit;

    ?>
    ```

    And send request to it:

    ```bash
    curl -H Cache-Control: no-cache -ks https://example.com/tls-check.php?${RANDOM} | grep "HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR\|HTTP_X_REAL_IP\|SERVER_ADDR\|REMOTE_ADDR"
    [HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR] => 172.217.20.206
    [HTTP_X_REAL_IP] => 172.217.20.206
    [SERVER_ADDR] => 192.168.10.100
    [REMOTE_ADDR] => 192.168.10.10
    ```

###### Improve extensibility with `Forwarded`

Since 2014, the IETF has approved a standard header definition for proxy, called `Forwarded`, documented [here](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7239) <sup>[IETF]</sup> and [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Forwarded) that should be use instead of `X-Forwarded` headers. This is the one you should use reliably to get originating IP in case your request is handled by a proxy. Official NGINX documentation also gives you how to [Using the Forwarded header](https://www.nginx.com/resources/wiki/start/topics/examples/forwarded/).

In general, the proxy headers (`Forwarded` or `X-Forwarded-For`) are the right way to get your client IP only when you are sure they come to you via a proxy. If there is no proxy header or no usable value in, you should default to the `REMOTE_ADDR` server variable.

##### Response headers

  > **:bookmark: [Set the HTTP headers with add_header and proxy_*_header directives properly - Base Rules - P1](RULES.md#beginner-set-the-http-headers-with-add_header-and-proxy__header-directives-properly)**

`add_header` directive allows you to define an arbitrary response header (mostly for informational/debugging purposes) and value to be included in all response codes which are equal to:

- 2xx series: 200, 201, 204, 206
- 3xx series: 301, 302, 303, 304, 307, 308

For example:

```nginx
add_header Custom-Header Value;
```

  > To change (adding or removing) existing headers you should use a [headers-more-nginx-module](https://github.com/openresty/headers-more-nginx-module) module.

There is one thing you must watch out for if you use `add_header` directive (also applies to `proxy_*_header` directives). See the following explanations:

- [Nginx add_header configuration pitfall](https://blog.g3rt.nl/nginx-add_header-pitfall.html)
- [Be very careful with your add_header in Nginx! You might make your site insecure](https://www.peterbe.com/plog/be-very-careful-with-your-add_header-in-nginx)

This is described in the official documentation:

  > _There could be several `add_header` directives. These directives are inherited from the previous level if and only if there are no `add_header` directives defined on the current level._

However - and this is important - as you now have defined a header in your `server` context, all the remaining headers defined in the `http` context will no longer be inherited. Means, youâ€™ve to define them in your `server` context again (or alternatively ignore them if theyâ€™re not important for your site).

At the end, summary about directives to manipulate headers:

- `proxy_set_header` - is to set a request header
- `add_header` is to add header to response
- `proxy_hide_header` is to hide a response header

#### Load balancing algorithms

Load Balancing is in principle a wonderful thing really. You can find out about it when you serve tens of thousands (or maybe more) of requests every second. Of course, load balancing is not the only reason - think also about maintenance tasks without downtime.

Generally load balancing is a technique used to distribute the workload across multiple computing resources and servers. I think you should always use this technique also if you have a simple app or whatever else what you're sharing with other.

The configuration is very simple. NGINX includes a `ngx_http_upstream_module` to define backends (groups of servers or multiple server instances). More specifically, the `upstream` directive is responsible for this.

  > `upstream` only provide a list of servers, some kind of weight, and other parameters related to the backend layer.

##### Backend parameters

  > **:bookmark: [Tweak passive health checks - Load Balancing - P3](RULES.md#beginner-tweak-passive-health-checks)**<br>
  > **:bookmark: [Don't disable backends by comments, use down parameter - Load Balancing - P4](RULES.md#beginner-dont-disable-backends-by-comments-use-down-parameter)**

Before we start talking about the load balancing techniques you should know something about `server` directive. It defines the address and other parameters of a backend servers.

This directive accepts the following options:

- `weight=<num>` - sets the weight of the origin server, e.g. `weight=10`

- `max_conns=<num>` - limits the maximum number of simultaneous active connections from the NGINX proxy server to an upstream server (default value: `0` = no limit), e.g. `max_conns=8`

  - if you set `max_conns=4` the 5th will be rejected
  - if the server group does not reside in the shared memory (`zone` directive), the limitation works per each worker process

- `max_fails=<num>` - the number of unsuccessful attempts to communicate with the backend (default value: `1`, `0` disables the accounting of attempts), e.g. `max_fails=3;`

- `fail_timeout=<time>` - the time during which the specified number of unsuccessful attempts to communicate with the server should happen to consider the server unavailable (default value: `10 seconds`), e.g. `fail_timeout=30s;`

- `zone <name> <size>` - defines shared memory zone that keeps the groupâ€™s configuration and run-time state that are shared between worker processes, e.g. `zone backend 32k;`

- `backup` - if server is marked as a backup server it does not receive requests unless both of the other servers are unavailable

- `down` - marks the server as permanently unavailable

##### Upstream servers with SSL

Setting up SSL termination on NGINX is also very simple using the SSL module. For this you need to use upstream module, and proxy module also. A very good case study is also given [here](https://www.nginx.com/resources/wiki/start/topics/examples/SSL-Offloader/).

For more information please read [Securing HTTP Traffic to Upstream Servers](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx/admin-guide/security-controls/securing-http-traffic-upstream/) from the official documentation.

##### Round Robin

It's the simpliest load balancing technique. Round Robin has the list of servers and forwards each request to each server from the list in order. Once it reaches the last server, the loop again jumps to the first server and start again.

```nginx
upstream bck_testing_01 {

  # with default weight for all (weight=1)
  server 192.168.250.220:8080;
  server 192.168.250.221:8080;
  server 192.168.250.222:8080;

}
```

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/trimstray/nginx-admins-handbook/blob/master/static/img/lb/nginx_lb_round-robin.png" alt="round-robin">
</p>

##### Weighted Round Robin

In Weighted Round Robin load balancing algorithm, each server is allocated with a weight based on its configuration and ability to process the request.

This method is similar to the Round Robin in a sense that the manner by which requests are assigned to the nodes is still cyclical, albeit with a twist. The node with the higher specs will be apportioned a greater number of requests.

```nginx
upstream bck_testing_01 {

  server 192.168.250.220:8080   weight=3;
  server 192.168.250.221:8080;              # default weight=1
  server 192.168.250.222:8080;              # default weight=1

}
```

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/trimstray/nginx-admins-handbook/blob/master/static/img/lb/nginx_lb_weighted-round-robin.png" alt="weighted-round-robin">
</p>

##### Least Connections

This method tells the load balancer to look at the connections going to each server and send the next connection to the server with the least amount of connections.

```nginx
upstream bck_testing_01 {

  least_conn;

  # with default weight for all (weight=1)
  server 192.168.250.220:8080;
  server 192.168.250.221:8080;
  server 192.168.250.222:8080;

}
```

For example: if clients D10, D11 and D12 attempts to connect after A4, C2 and C8 have already disconnected but A1, B3, B5, B6, C7 and A9 are still connected, the load balancer will assign client D10 to server 2 instead of server 1 and server 3. After that, client D11 will be assign to server 1 and client D12 will be assign to server 2.

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/trimstray/nginx-admins-handbook/blob/master/static/img/lb/nginx_lb_least-conn.png" alt="least-conn">
</p>

##### Weighted Least Connections

This is, in general, a very fair distribution method, as it uses the ratio of the number of connections and the weight of a server. The server in the cluster with the lowest ratio automatically receives the next request.

```nginx
upstream bck_testing_01 {

  least_conn;

  server 192.168.250.220:8080   weight=3;
  server 192.168.250.221:8080;              # default weight=1
  server 192.168.250.222:8080;              # default weight=1

}
```

For example: if clients D10, D11 and D12 attempts to connect after A4, C2 and C8 have already disconnected but A1, B3, B5, B6, C7 and A9 are still connected, the load balancer will assign client D10 to server 2 or 3 (because they have a least active connections) instead of server 1. After that, client D11 and D12 will be assign to server 1 because it has the biggest `weight` parameter.

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/trimstray/nginx-admins-handbook/blob/master/static/img/lb/nginx_lb_weighted-least-conn.png" alt="weighted-least-conn">
</p>

##### IP Hash

The IP Hash method uses the IP of the client to create a unique hash key and associates the hash with one of the servers. This ensures that a user is sent to the same server in future sessions (a basic kind of session persistence) except when this server is unavailable. If one of the servers needs to be temporarily removed, it should be marked with the `down` parameter in order to preserve the current hashing of client IP addresses.

This technique is especially helpful if actions between sessions has to be kept alive e.g. products put in the shopping cart or when the session state is of concern and not handled by shared memory of the application.

```nginx
upstream bck_testing_01 {

  ip_hash;

  # with default weight for all (weight=1)
  server 192.168.250.220:8080;
  server 192.168.250.221:8080;
  server 192.168.250.222:8080;

}
```

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/trimstray/nginx-admins-handbook/blob/master/static/img/lb/nginx_lb_ip-hash.png" alt="ip-hash">
</p>

##### Generic Hash

This technique is very similar to the IP Hash but for each request the load balancer calculates a hash that is based on the combination of a text string, variable, or a combination you specify, and associates the hash with one of the servers.

```nginx
upstream bck_testing_01 {

  hash $request_uri;

  # with default weight for all (weight=1)
  server 192.168.250.220:8080;
  server 192.168.250.221:8080;
  server 192.168.250.222:8080;

}
```

For example: load balancer calculate hash from the full original request URI (with arguments). Clients A4, C7, C8 and A9 sends requests to the `/static` location and will be assign to server 1. Similarly clients A1, C2, B6 which get `/sitemap.xml` resource they will be assign to server 2. Clients B3 and B5 sends requests to the `/api/v4` and they will be assign to server 3.

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/trimstray/nginx-admins-handbook/blob/master/static/img/lb/nginx_lb_generic-hash.png" alt="generic-hash">
</p>

##### Other methods

It is similar to the Generic Hash method because you can also specify a unique hash identifier but the assignment to the appropriate server is under your control. I think it's a somewhat primitive method and I wouldn't say it is a full load balancing technique, but in some cases it is very useful.

  > Mainly this helps reducing the mess on the configuration made by a lot of `location` blocks with similar configurations.

First of all create a map:

```nginx
map $request_uri $bck_testing_01 {

  default       "192.168.250.220:8080";

  /api/v4       "192.168.250.220:8080";
  /api/v3       "192.168.250.221:8080";
  /static       "192.168.250.222:8080";
  /sitemap.xml  "192.168.250.222:8080";

}
```

And add `proxy_pass` directive:

```nginx
server {

  ...

  location / {

    proxy_pass    http://$bck_testing_01;

  }

  ...

}
```

#### Rate limiting

NGINX has a default module to setup rate limiting. For me, it's one of the most useful protect feature but sometimes really hard to understand.

I think, in case of doubt, you should read up on the following documents:

- [Rate Limiting with NGINX and NGINX Plus](https://www.nginx.com/blog/rate-limiting-nginx/)
- [NGINX rate-limiting in a nutshell](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/nginx-rate-limiting-in-a-nutshell-128fe9e0126c/)
- [NGINX Rate Limiting](https://dzone.com/articles/nginx-rate-limiting)
- [How to protect your web site from HTTP request flood, DoS and brute-force attacks](https://www.ryadel.com/en/nginx-request-rate-limit-protect-web-site-http-request-flood-dos-brute-force/)

Rate limiting rules are useful for:

- traffic shaping
- traffic optimising
- slow down the rate of incoming requests
- protect http requests flood
- protect against slow http attacks
- prevent consume a lot of bandwidth
- mitigating ddos attacks
- protect brute-force attacks

##### Variables

NGINX has following variables (unique keys) that can be used in a rate limiting rules. For example:

| <b>VARIABLE</b> | <b>DESCRIPTION</b> |
| :---         | :---         |
| `$remote_addr` | client address |
| `$binary_remote_addr`| client address in a binary form, it is smaller and saves space then `remote_addr` |
| `$server_name` | name of the server which accepted a request |
| `$request_uri` | full original request URI (with arguments) |
| `$query_string` | arguments in the request line |

<sup><i>Please see [official doc](https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_core_module.html#variables) for more information about variables.</i></sup>

##### Directives, keys, and zones

NGINX also provides following keys:

| <b>KEY</b> | <b>DESCRIPTION</b> |
| :---         | :---         |
| `limit_req_zone` | stores the current number of excessive requests |
| `limit_conn_zone` | stores the maximum allowed number of connections |

and directives:

| <b>DIRECTIVE</b> | <b>DESCRIPTION</b> |
| :---         | :---         |
| `limit_req` | in combination with a `limit_conn_zone` sets the shared memory zone and the maximum burst size of requests |
| `limit_conn` | in combination with a `limit_req_zone` sets the shared memory zone and the maximum allowed number of (simultaneous) connections to the server per a client IP |

Keys are used to store the state of each IP address and how often it has accessed a limited object. This information are stored in shared memory available from all NGINX worker processes.

  > You can enable the dry run mode with `limit_req_dry_run on;`. In this mode, requests processing rate is not limited, however, in the shared memory zone, the number of excessive requests is accounted as usual.

Both keys also provides response status parameters indicating too many requests or connections with specific http code (default **503**).

- `limit_req_status <value>`
- `limit_conn_status <value>`

For example, if you want to set the desired logging level for cases when the server limits the number of connections:

```nginx
# Add this to http context:
limit_req_status 429;

# Set your own error page for 429 http code:
error_page 429 /rate_limit.html;
location = /rate_limit.html {

  root /usr/share/www/http-error-pages/sites/other;
  internal;

}
```

And create this file:

```bash
cat > /usr/share/www/http-error-pages/sites/other/rate_limit.html << __EOF__
HTTP 429 Too Many Requests
__EOF__
```

Rate limiting rules also have zones that lets you define a shared space in which to count the incoming requests or connections.

  > All requests or connections coming into the same space will be counted in the same rate limit. This is what allows you to limit per URL, per IP, or anything else.

The zone has two required parts:

- `<name>` - is the zone identifier
- `<size>` - is the zone size

Example:

```
<key> <variable> zone=<name>:<size>;
```

  > State information for about **16,000** IP addresses takes **1 megabyte**. So **1 kilobyte** zone has **16** IP addresses.

The range of zones is as follows:

- **http context**

  ```nginx
  http {

    ... zone=<name>;

  ```

- **server context**

  ```nginx
  server {

    ... zone=<name>;

  ```

- **location directive**

  ```nginx
  location /api {

    ... zone=<name>;

  ```

  > All rate limiting rules (definitions) should be added to the NGINX `http` context.

`limit_req_zone` key lets you set `rate` parameter (optional) - it defines the rate limited URL(s).

##### Burst and nodelay parameters

For enable queue you should use `limit_req` or `limit_conn` directives (see above). `limit_req` also provides optional parameters:

| <b>PARAMETER</b> | <b>DESCRIPTION</b> |
| :---         | :---         |
| `burst=<num>` | sets the maximum number of excessive requests that await to be processed in a timely manner; maximum requests as `rate` * `burst` in `burst` seconds |
| `nodelay`| it imposes a rate limit without constraining the allowed spacing between requests; default NGINX would return 503 response and not handle excessive requests |

  > `nodelay` parameters are only useful when you also set a `burst`.

Without `nodelay` NGINX would wait (no 503 response) and handle excessive requests with some delay.

#### Core modules

##### ngx_http_geo_module

Documentation:

- [`ngx_http_geo_module`](https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_geo_module.html)

This module makes available variables, whose values depend on the IP address of the client. When combined with GeoIP module allows for very elaborate rules serving content according to the geolocation context.

By default, the IP address used for doing the lookup is `$remote_addr`, but it is possible to specify an another variable.

  > If the value of a variable does not represent a valid IP address then the `255.255.255.255` address is used.

###### Performance

Look at this (from official documentation):

  > _Since variables are evaluated only when used, the mere existence of even a large number of declared `geo` variables does not cause any extra costs for request processing._

This module (watch out: don't mistake this module for the GeoIP) builds in-memory radix tree when loading configs. This is the same data structure as used in routing, and lookups are really fast. If you have many unique values per networks, then this long load time is caused by searching duplicates of data in array. Otherwise, it may be caused by insertions to a radix tree.

###### Examples

  > See [Use geo/map modules instead of allow/deny](RULES.md#beginner-use-geomap-modules-instead-of-allowdeny) from this handbook.

```nginx
# The variable created is $trusted_ips:
geo $trusted_ips {

  default       0;
  192.0.0.0/24  0;
  8.8.8.8       1;

}

server {

  if ( $trusted_ips = 1 ) {

    return 403;

  }

  ...

}
```

  > If the value of a variable does not represent a valid IP address then the `255.255.255.255` address is used.

You can also test IP ranges, for example:

```nginx
# Create geo-ranges.conf:
127.0.0.0-127.255.255.255   loopback;

# Add geo definition:
geo $geo_ranges {

  ranges;
  default                   default;
  include                   geo-ranges.conf;
  10.255.0.0-10.255.255.255 internal;

}
```

#### 3rd party modules

##### ngx_set_misc

Documentation:

- [`ngx_set_misc`](https://github.com/openresty/set-misc-nginx-module)

##### ngx_http_geoip_module

Documentation:

- [`ngx_http_geoip_module`](http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_geoip_module.html)
- [`ngx_http_geoip2_module`](https://github.com/leev/ngx_http_geoip2_module)

This module allows real-time queries against the Max Mind GeoIP database. It uses the old version of API, still very common on OS distributions. For using the new version of GeoIP API, see geoip2 module.

The Max Mind GeoIP database is a map of IP network address assignments to geographical locales that can be useful - though approximate - in identifying the physical location with which an IP host address is associated on a relatively granular level.

###### Performance

The GeoIP module sets multiple variables and by default NGINX parses and loads geoip data into memory once the config file only on (re)start or SIGHUP.

  > GeoIP lookups come from a distributed database rather than from a dynamic server, so unlike DNS, the worst-case performance hit is minimal. Additionally, from a performance point of view, you should not worry, as geoip database are stored in memory (at the reading configuration phase) and NGINX doing lookups very fast.

GeoIP module creates (and assigns values to) variables based on the IP address of the request client and one of Maxmind GeoIP databases. One of the common uses is to set the country of the end-user as a NGINX variable.

Variables in NGINX are evaluated only on demand. If `$geoip_*` variable was not used during the request processing, then geoip db was not lookuped. So, if you don't call the geoip variable on your app the geoip module wont be executed at all. The only inconvenience of using really large geobases is config reading time.
