#### :beginner: Organising Nginx configuration

###### Rationale

  > When your NGINX configuration grow, the need for organising your configuration will also grow. Well organised code is:
  >
  > - easier to understand
  > - easier to maintain
  > - easier to work with

  > Use `include` directive to move and to split common server settings into a multiple files and to attach your specific code to global config or contexts. This helps in organizing code into logical components. Inclusions are processed recursively, that is, an include file can further have include statements.

  > I always try to keep multiple directories in root of configuration tree. These directories stores all configuration files which are attached to the main file (e.g. `nginx.conf`). I prefer the following structure:
  >
  > - `html` - for default static files, e.g. global 5xx error page
  > - `master` - for main configuration, e.g. acls, listen directives, and domains
  >   - `_acls` - for access control lists, e.g. geo or map modules
  >   - `_basic` - for rate limiting rules, redirect maps, or proxy params
  >   - `_listen` - for all listen directives; also stores SSL configuration
  >   - `_server` - for domains (localhost) configuration; also stores all backends definitions
  > - `modules` - for modules which are dynamically loading into NGINX
  > - `snippets` - for NGINX aliases, configuration templates
  >
  > I attach some of them, if necessary, mostly to the files which has `server` directives.

###### Example

```nginx
# Store this in https.conf for example:
listen 10.240.20.2:443 ssl;

ssl_certificate /etc/nginx/master/_server/example.com/certs/nginx_example.com_bundle.crt;
ssl_certificate_key /etc/nginx/master/_server/example.com/certs/example.com.key;

...

# Include 'https.conf' to the server section:
server {

  include /etc/nginx/master/_listen/10.240.20.2/https.conf;

  # And other:
  include /etc/nginx/master/_static/errors.conf;
  include /etc/nginx/master/_server/_helpers/global.conf;

  ...

  server_name example.com www.example.com;

  ...
```

#### :beginner: Format, prettify and indent your Nginx code

###### Rationale

  > Work with unreadable configuration files is terrible. If syntax is not very clear and readable, it makes your eyes sore, and you suffers from headaches.

  > When your code is formatted, it is significantly easier to maintain, debug, optimise, and can be read and understood in a short amount of time. You should eliminate code style violations from your NGINX configuration files.

  > Spaces, tabs, and new line characters are not part of the NGINX configuration. They are not interpreted by the NGINX engine, but they help to make the configuration more readable.

  > Choose your formatter style and setup a common config for it. Some rules are universal, but the most important thing is to keep a consistent NGINX code style throughout your code base:
  >
  > - use whitespaces and blank lines to arrange and separate code blocks
  > - tabs vs spaces - more important to be consistent throughout your code than to use any specific type
  >   - tabs are consistent, customizable and allow mistakes to be more noticeable (unless you are a 4 space kind of guy)
  >   - a space is always one column, use it if you want your beautiful work to appear right for everyone.
  > - use comments to explain why things are done not what is done
  > - use meaningful naming conventions
  > - simple is better than complex but complex is better than complicated

  > Some would say that NGINX's files are written in their own language or syntax so we should not overdo it with above rules. I think it's worth sticking to the general (programming) rules and make your and other NGINX adminstrators life easier.

###### Example

Not recommended code style:

```nginx
http {
  include    nginx/proxy.conf;
  include    /etc/nginx/fastcgi.conf;
  index    index.html index.htm index.php;

  default_type application/octet-stream;
  log_format   main '$remote_addr - $remote_user [$time_local]  $status '
    '"$request" $body_bytes_sent "$http_referer" '
    '"$http_user_agent" "$http_x_forwarded_for"';
  access_log   logs/access.log    main;
  sendfile on;
  tcp_nopush   on;
  server_names_hash_bucket_size 128; # this seems to be required for some vhosts

  ...
```

Recommended code style:

```nginx
http {

  # Attach global rules:
  include         /etc/nginx/proxy.conf;
  include         /etc/nginx/fastcgi.conf;

  index           index.html index.htm index.php;

  default_type    application/octet-stream;

  # Standard log format:
  log_format      main '$remote_addr - $remote_user [$time_local]  $status '
                       '"$request" $body_bytes_sent "$http_referer" '
                       '"$http_user_agent" "$http_x_forwarded_for"';

  access_log      /var/log/nginx/access.log main;

  sendfile        on;
  tcp_nopush      on;

  # This seems to be required for some vhosts:
  server_names_hash_bucket_size 128;

  ...
```

#### :beginner: Use `reload` option to change configurations on the fly

###### Rationale

  > Use the `reload` option to achieve a graceful reload of the configuration without stopping the server and dropping any packets. This function of the master process allows to rolls back the changes and continues to work with stable and old working configuration.

  > This ability of NGINX is very critical in a high-uptime and dynamic environments for keeping the load balancer or standalone server online.

  > Master process checks the syntax validity of the new configuration and tries to apply all changes. If this procedure has been accomplished, the master process create new worker processes and sends shutdown messages to old. Old workers stops accepting new connections after received a shut down signal but current requests are still processing. After that, the old workers exit.

  > When you restart the NGINX service you might encounter situation in which NGINX will stop, and won't start back again, because of syntax error. Reload method is safer than restarting because before old process will be terminated, new configuration file is parsed and whole process is aborted if there are any problems with it.

  > To stop processes with waiting for the worker processes to finish serving current requests use `nginx -s quit` command. It's better than `nginx -s stop` for fast shutdown.

  From NGINX documentation:

  > _In order for NGINX to re-read the configuration file, a `HUP` signal should be sent to the master process. The master process first checks the syntax validity, then tries to apply new configuration, that is, to open log files and new listen sockets. If this fails, it rolls back changes and continues to work with old configuration. If this succeeds, it starts new worker processes, and sends messages to old worker processes requesting them to shut down gracefully. Old worker processes close listen sockets and continue to service old clients. After all clients are serviced, old worker processes are shut down._

###### Example

```bash
# 1)
systemctl reload nginx

# 2)
service nginx reload

# 3)
/etc/init.d/nginx reload

# 4)
/usr/sbin/nginx -s reload

# 5)
kill -HUP $(cat /var/run/nginx.pid)
# or
kill -HUP $(pgrep -f "nginx: master")

# 6)
/usr/sbin/nginx -g 'daemon on; master_process on;' -s reload
```

#### :beginner: Separate `listen` directives for 80 and 443 ports

###### Rationale

  > If you served HTTP and HTTPS with the exact same config (a single server that handles both HTTP and HTTPS requests) NGINX is intelligent enough to ignore the SSL directives if loaded over port 80.

  > I don't like duplicating the rules, but separate `listen` directives is certainly to help you maintain and modify your configuration. I always split the configuration if I want to redirect from HTTP to HTTPS.

  > It's useful if you pin multiple domains to one IP address. This allows you to attach one `listen` directive (e.g. if you keep it in the configuration file) to multiple domains configurations.

  > It may also be necessary to hardcode the domains if you're using HTTPS, because you have to know upfront which certificates you'll be providing.

  > You should also use `return` directive for redirect from HTTP to HTTPS (to hardcode everything, and not use regular expressions at all).

###### Example

```nginx
# For HTTP:
server {

  listen 10.240.20.2:80;

  ...

}

# For HTTPS:
server {

  listen 10.240.20.2:443 ssl;

  ...

}
```

- [Force all connections over TLS (from this handbook)](doc/RULES.md#beginner-force-all-connections-over-tls)

#### :beginner: Define the `listen` directives with `address:port` pair

###### Rationale

  > NGINX translates all incomplete `listen` directives by substituting missing values with their default values.

  > And what's more, will only evaluate the `server_name` directive when it needs to distinguish between server blocks that match to the same level in the `listen` directive.

  > Set IP address and port number to prevents soft mistakes which may be difficult to debug.

###### Example

```nginx
# Client side:
curl -Iks http://api.random.com

# Server side:
server {

  # This block will be processed:
  listen 192.168.252.10;  # --> 192.168.252.10:80

  ...

}

server {

  listen 80;  # --> *:80 --> 0.0.0.0:80
  server_name api.random.com;

  ...

}
```

#### :beginner: Prevent processing requests with undefined server names

###### Rationale

  > The `Host` header tells the server which virtual host to use (if set up). You can even have the same virtual host using several aliases (= domains and wildcard-domains). This header can also be modified so NGINX should prevent processing requests with undefined server names (also on IP address).

  > It protects against configuration errors, e.g. traffic forwarding to incorrect backends, bypassing filters like an ACLs or WAFs. The problem is easily solved by creating a default dummy vhost that catches all requests with unrecognized `Host` headers.

  > If none of the `listen` directives have the `default_server` parameter then the first server with the `address:port` pair will be the default server for this pair (it means that the NGINX always has a default server).

  > If someone makes a request using an IP address instead of a server name, the `Host` request header field will contain the IP address and the request can be handled using the IP address as the server name.

  > The server name `_` is not required in modern versions of NGINX (so you can put anything there). In fact, the `default_server` does not need a `server_name` statement because it match anything that the other server blocks does not explicitly match.

  > If a server with a matching `listen` and `server_name` cannot be found, NGINX will use the default server. If your configurations are spread across multiple files, there evaluation order will be ambiguous, so you need to mark the default server explicitly.

  > NGINX uses `Host` header for `server_name` matching. It does not use TLS SNI. This means that for an SSL server, NGINX must be able to accept SSL connection, which boils down to having certificate/key. The cert/key can be any, e.g. self-signed.

  > There is a simple procedure for all non defined server names:
  >
  > - one `server` block, with...
  > - complete `listen` directive, with...
  > - `default_server` parameter, with...
  > - only one `server_name` (but not required) definition, and...
  > - preventively I add it at the beginning of the configuration

  > Also good point is `return 444;` for default server name because this will close the connection (which will kill the connection without sending any headers) and log it internally, for any domain that isn't defined in NGINX. In addition, I would implement rate limiting rule.

###### Example

```nginx
# Place it at the beginning of the configuration file to prevent mistakes:
server {

  # For ssl option remember about SSL parameters (private key, certs, cipher suites, etc.);
  # add default_server to your listen directive in the server that you want to act as the default:
  listen 10.240.20.2:443 default_server ssl;

  # We catch:
  #   - invalid domain names
  #   - requests without the "Host" header
  #   - and all others (also due to the above setting)
  #   - default_server in server_name directive is not required
  #     I add this for a better understanding and I think it's an unwritten standard
  # ...but you should know that it's irrelevant, really, you can put in everything there.
  server_name _ "" default_server;

  limit_req zone=per_ip_5r_s;

  ...

  return 444;

  # We can also serve:
  # location / {

    # static file (error page):
    #   root /etc/nginx/error-pages/404;
    # or redirect:
    #   return 301 https://badssl.com;

  # }

}

server {

  listen 10.240.20.2:443 ssl;

  server_name example.com;

  ...

}

server {

  listen 10.240.20.2:443 ssl;

  server_name domain.org;

  ...

}
```

#### :beginner: Never use a hostname in the `listen` or `upstream` directives

###### Rationale

  > Generaly, uses of hostnames in the `listen` or `upstream` directives is a bad practice. In the worst case NGINX won't be able to bind to the desired TCP socket which will prevent NGINX from starting at all.

  > The best and safer way is to know the IP address that needs to be bound to and use that address instead of the hostname. This also prevents NGINX from needing to look up the address and removes dependencies on external and internal resolvers.

  > Uses of `$hostname` (the machineâ€™s hostname) variable in the `server_name` directive is also example of bad practice (it's similar to use hostname label).

  > I believe it is also necessary to set IP address and port number pair to prevents soft mistakes which may be difficult to debug.

###### Example

Not recommended configuration:

```nginx
upstream bk_01 {

  server http://x-9s-web01-prod.int:8080;

}

server {

  listen rev-proxy-prod:80;

  ...

  location / {

    # It's OK, bk_01 is the internal name:
    proxy_pass http://bk_01;

    ...

  }

  location /api {

    proxy_pass http://x-9s-web01-prod-api.int:80;

    ...

  }

  ...

}
```

Recommended configuration:

```nginx
upstream bk_01 {

  server http://192.168.252.200:8080;

}

server {

  listen 10.10.100.20:80;

  ...

  location / {

    # It's OK, bk_01 is the internal name:
    proxy_pass http://bk_01;

    ...

  }

  location /api {

    proxy_pass http://192.168.253.10:80;

    ...

#### :beginner: Set the HTTP headers with `add_header` and `proxy_*_header` directives properly

###### Rationale

  > The `add_header` directive works in the `if`, `location`, `server`, and `http` scopes. The `proxy_*_header` directives works in the `location`, `server`, and `http` contexts. These directives are inherited from the previous level if and only if there are no `add_header` or `proxy_*_header` directives defined on the current level.

  > If you use them in multiple contexes only the lowest occurrences are used. So if you specify it in the `server` and `location` contexts (even if you hide different header) only the one of them in the `location` block are used. To prevent this situation, you should define a common config snippet for all contexts and use it on each level.

  > The most predictable solution is include your file with all headers at the `location` level. So, you should only include it in each individual `location` where you want these headers to be sent.

  > In my opinion, also good solution is use an include file with your global headers and add it to the `http` context. You should also set up other include file with your server/domain specific configuration (but always with your global headers! You have to repeat it in the lowest contexts) and add it to the `server/location` contexts.

  > There are solutions to this such as using an alternative module like a [headers-more-nginx-module](https://github.com/openresty/headers-more-nginx-module) for define specific headers in you `server` or `location` blocks.

  There is a [great explanation](https://www.keycdn.com/support/nginx-add_header) of the problem:

  > _Therefore, letâ€™s say you have an http block and have specified the `add_header` directive within that block. Then, within the http block you have 2 server blocks - one for HTTP and one for HTTPs._
  >
  > _Letâ€™s say we donâ€™t include an `add_header` directive within the HTTP server block, however we do include an additional `add_header` within the HTTPs server block. In this scenario, the `add_header` directive defined in the http block will only be inherited by the HTTP server block as it does not have any `add_header` directive defined on the current level. On the other hand, the HTTPS server block will not inherit the `add_header` directive defined in the http block._

###### Example

Some extra headers with `add_header` directive here but only if you include "global" headers first:

```nginx
http {

  ...

  include /etc/nginx/ngx_headers_global.conf;

  server {

    server_name example.com;

    ...

    include /etc/nginx/ngx_headers_global.conf;

    location / {

      include /etc/nginx/ngx_headers_global.conf;
      add_header Foo bar;

      ...

    }

  }

  server {

    server_name blog.example.com;

    ...

    location / {

      ...

    }

  }

}
```

Or some extra headers with `more_set_headers` directive here regardless of whether you include "global" headers first:

```nginx
http {

  ...

  include /etc/nginx/ngx_headers_global.conf;

  server {

    server_name example.com;

    ...

    include /etc/nginx/ngx_headers_global.conf;

    location / {

      more_set_headers 'Foo: bar';

      ...

    }

  }

}
```

Example for `proxy_hide_header` and `proxy_set_header` (but I also recommend using them from the attached file):

```nginx
http {

  ...

  proxy_set_header Host $host;
  proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
  proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
  proxy_hide_header X-Powered-By;

  server {

    server_name example.com;

    ...

    proxy_set_header Host $host;
    proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
    proxy_hide_header X-Powered-By;

    location / {

      more_set_headers 'Foo: bar';

      ...

    }

  }

  server {

    server_name blog.example.com;

    ...

    location / {

      more_set_headers 'Foo: bar';

      ...

    }

  }

}
```

#### :beginner: Use only one SSL config for the `listen` directive

###### Rationale

  > For me, this rule making it easier to debug and maintain. It also prevents multiple TLS configurations on the same listening address.

  > You should use one SSL config for sharing a single IP address between several HTTPS servers (e.g. protocols, ciphers, curves). It's to prevent mistakes and configuration mismatch.

  > Using a common TLS configuration (stored in one file and added using the include directive) for all `server` contexts prevents strange behaviors. I think no better cure for a possible configuration clutter.

  > Remember that regardless of SSL parameters you are able to use multiple SSL certificates on the same `listen` directive (IP address). Also some of the TLS parameters may be different.

  > Also remember about configuration for default server. It's important because if none of the listen directives have the `default_server` parameter then the first server in your configuration will be default server. So you should use only one SSL setup for several server names on the same IP address.

  From NGINX documentation:

  > _This is caused by SSL protocol behaviour. The SSL connection is established before the browser sends an HTTP request and nginx does not know the name of the requested server. Therefore, it may only offer the default serverâ€™s certificate._

  Also take a look at this:

  > _A more generic solution for running several HTTPS servers on a single IP address is TLS Server Name Indication extension (SNI, [RFC6066 - Transport Layer Security (TLS) Extensions: Extension Definitions](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6066) <sup>[IETF]</sup>), which allows a browser to pass a requested server name during the SSL handshake and, therefore, the server will know which certificate it should use for the connection._

###### Example

```nginx
# Store this configuration in e.g. https.conf:
ssl_protocols TLSv1.2;
ssl_ciphers "ECDHE-ECDSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:ECDHE-ECDSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305:ECDHE-RSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305:ECDHE-ECDSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:ECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:DHE-RSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305:DHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256";

ssl_prefer_server_ciphers on;

ssl_ecdh_curve secp521r1:secp384r1;

...

# Include this file to the server context (attach domain-a.com for specific listen directive):
server {

  listen 192.168.252.10:443 default_server ssl http2;

  include             /etc/nginx/https.conf;

  server_name         domain-a.com;

  ssl_certificate     domain-a.com.crt;
  ssl_certificate_key domain-a.com.key;

  ...

}

# Include this file to the server context (attach domain-b.com for specific listen directive):
server {

  listen 192.168.252.10:443 ssl http2;

  include             /etc/nginx/https.conf;

  server_name         domain-b.com;

  ssl_certificate     domain-b.com.crt;
  ssl_certificate_key domain-b.com.key;

  ...

}
```

#### :beginner: Use geo/map modules instead of allow/deny

###### Rationale

  > Use `map` or `geo` modules (one of them) to prevent users abusing your servers. This allows to create variables with values depending on the client IP address.

  > Since variables are evaluated only when used, the mere existence of even a large number of declared e.g. `geo` variables does not cause any extra costs for request processing.

  > These directives provides the perfect way to block invalid visitors e.g. with `ngx_http_geoip_module`. For example, `geo` module is great for conditionally allow or deny IP.

  > `geo` module (watch out: don't mistake this module for the GeoIP) builds in-memory radix tree when loading configs. This is the same data structure as used in routing, and lookups are really fast. If you have many unique values per networks, then this long load time is caused by searching duplicates of data in array. Otherwise, it may be caused by insertions to a radix tree.

  > If you use `*ACCESS_PHASE` (e.g. `allow/deny` directives) remember that NGINX process request in phases, and `rewrite` phase (where `return` belongs) goes before `access` phase (where `deny` works). See [Allow and deny](NGINX_BASICS.md#allow-and-deny) chapter to learn more.

  > I use both modules for a large lists. You should've thought about it because this rule requires to use several `if` conditions. I think that `allow/deny` directives are better solution for simple lists, after all. Take a look at the example below:

```nginx
# Allow/deny:
location /internal {

  include acls/internal.conf;
  allow   192.168.240.0/24;
  deny    all;

  ...

# vs geo/map:
location /internal {

  if ($globals_internal_map_acl) {
    set $pass 1;
  }

  if ($pass = 1) {
    proxy_pass http://localhost:80;
  }

  if ($pass != 1) {
    return 403;
  }

  ...

}
```

###### Example

```nginx
# Map module:
map $remote_addr $globals_internal_map_acl {

  # Status code:
  #  - 0 = false
  #  - 1 = true
  default 0;

  ### INTERNAL ###
  10.255.10.0/24 1;
  10.255.20.0/24 1;
  10.255.30.0/24 1;
  192.168.0.0/16 1;

}

# Geo module:
geo $globals_internal_geo_acl {

  # Status code:
  #  - 0 = false
  #  - 1 = true
  default 0;

  ### INTERNAL ###
  10.255.10.0/24 1;
  10.255.20.0/24 1;
  10.255.30.0/24 1;
  192.168.0.0/16 1;

}
```

#### :beginner: Map all the things...

###### Rationale

  > Manage a large number of redirects with maps and use them to customise your key-value pairs. If you are ever faced with using an if during a request, you should check to see if you can use a `map` instead.

  > The `map` directive maps strings, so it is possible to represent e.g. `192.168.144.0/24` as a regular expression and continue to use the `map` directive.

  > Map module provides a more elegant solution for clearly parsing a big list of regexes, e.g. User-Agents, Referrers.

  > You can also use `include` directive for your maps so your config files would look pretty.

###### Example

```nginx
# Define in an external file (e.g. maps/http_user_agent.conf):
map $http_user_agent $device_redirect {

  default "desktop";

  ~(?i)ip(hone|od) "mobile";
  ~(?i)android.*(mobile|mini) "mobile";
  ~Mobile.+Firefox "mobile";
  ~^HTC "mobile";
  ~Fennec "mobile";
  ~IEMobile "mobile";
  ~BB10 "mobile";
  ~SymbianOS.*AppleWebKit "mobile";
  ~Opera\sMobi "mobile";

}

# Include to the server context:
include maps/http_user_agent.conf;

# And turn on in a specific context (e.g. location):
if ($device_redirect = "mobile") {

  return 301 https://m.example.com$request_uri;

}
```

#### :beginner: Set global root directory for unmatched locations

###### Rationale

  > Set global `root` inside server directive for requests. It specifies the root directory for undefined locations.

  > If you define `root` in a `location` block it will only be available in that `location`. This almost always leads to duplication of either `root` directives of file paths, neither of which is good.

  > If you define it in the `server` block it is always inherited by the `location` blocks so it will always be available in the `$document_root` variable, thus avoiding the duplication of file paths.

  From official documentation:

  > _If you add a `root` to every location block then a location block that isnâ€™t matched will have no `root`. Therefore, it is important that a `root` directive occur prior to your location blocks, which can then override this directive if they need to._

###### Example

```nginx
server {

  server_name example.com;

  root /var/www/example.com/public;

  location / {

    ...

  }

  location /api {

    ...

  }

  location /static {

    root /var/www/example.com/static;

    ...

  }

}
```

###### External resources

- [Nginx Pitfalls: Root inside location block](http://wiki.nginx.org/Pitfalls#Root_inside_Location_Block)

#### :beginner: Use `return` directive for URL redirection (301, 302)

###### Rationale

  > It's a simple rule. You should use server blocks and `return` statements as they're way faster than evaluating RegEx.

  > It is simpler and faster because NGINX stops processing the request (and doesn't have to process a regular expressions). More than that, you can specify a code in the 3xx series.

  > If you have a scenario where you need to validate the URL with a regex or need to capture elements in the original URL (that are obviously not in a corresponding NGINX variable), then you should use `rewrite`.

###### Example

```nginx
server {

  listen 192.168.252.10:80;

  server_name www.example.com;

  ...

  # return  301 https://$host$request_uri;
  return    301 https://example.com$request_uri;

}

server {

  ...

  server_name example.com;

  return      301 $scheme://www.example.com$request_uri;

}
```

#### :beginner: Configure log rotation policy

###### Rationale

  > Log files gives you feedback about the activity and performance of the server as well as any problems that may be occurring. They are records details about requests and NGINX internals. Unfortunately, logs use more disk space.

  > You should define a process which periodically archiving the current log file and starting a new one, renames and optionally compresses the current log files, delete old log files, and force the logging system to begin using new log files.

  > I think the best tool for this is a `logrotate`. I use it everywhere if I want to manage logs automatically, and for a good night's sleep also. It is a simple program to rotate logs, uses crontab to work. It's scheduled work, not a daemon, so no need to reload its configuration.

###### Example

- for manually rotation:

  ```bash
  # Check manually (all log files):
  logrotate -dv /etc/logrotate.conf

  # Check manually with force rotation (specific log file):
  logrotate -dv --force /etc/logrotate.d/nginx
  ```

- for automate rotation:

  ```bash
  # GNU/Linux distributions:
  cat > /etc/logrotate.d/nginx << __EOF__
  /var/log/nginx/*.log {

#### :beginner: Don't duplicate `index` directive, use it only in the http block

###### Rationale

  > Use the `index` directive one time. It only needs to occur in your `http` context and it will be inherited below.

  > I think we should be careful about duplicating the same rules. But, of course, rules duplication is sometimes okay or not necessarily a great evil.

###### Example

Not recommended configuration:

```nginx
http {

  ...

  index index.php index.htm index.html;

  server {

    server_name www.example.com;

    location / {

      index index.php index.html index.$geo.html;

      ...

    }

  }

  server {

    server_name www.example.com;

    location / {

      index index.php index.htm index.html;

      ...

    }

    location /data {

      index index.php;

      ...

    }

    ...

}
```

Recommended configuration:

```nginx
http {

  ...

  index index.php index.htm index.html index.$geo.html;

  server {

    server_name www.example.com;

    location / {

      ...

    }

  }

  server {

    server_name www.example.com;

    location / {

      ...

    }

    location /data {

      ...

    }

    ...

#### :beginner: Use custom log formats

###### Rationale

  > Anything you can access as a variable in NGINX config, you can log, including non-standard http headers, etc. so it's a simple way to create your own log format for specific situations.

  > This is extremely helpful for debugging specific `location` directives.

  > I also use custom log formats for analyze of the users traffic profiles (e.g. SSL/TLS version, ciphers, and many more).

###### Example

```nginx
# Default main log format from nginx repository:
log_format main
                '$remote_addr - $remote_user [$time_local] "$request" '
                '$status $body_bytes_sent "$http_referer" '
                '"$http_user_agent" "$http_x_forwarded_for"';

# Extended main log format:
log_format main-level-0
                '$remote_addr - $remote_user [$time_local] '
                '"$request_method $scheme://$host$request_uri '
                '$server_protocol" $status $body_bytes_sent '
                '"$http_referer" "$http_user_agent" '
                '$request_time';

# Debug log formats:
#   - level 0
#   - based on main-level-0 without "$http_referer" "$http_user_agent"
log_format debug-level-0
                '$remote_addr - $remote_user [$time_local] '
                '"$request_method $scheme://$host$request_uri '
                '$server_protocol" $status $body_bytes_sent '
                '$request_id $pid $msec $request_time '
                '$upstream_connect_time $upstream_header_time '
                '$upstream_response_time "$request_filename" '
                '$request_completion';
```

- [Custom log formats (from this handbook)](HELPERS.md#custom-log-formats)

#### :beginner: Use debug mode to track down unexpected behaviour

###### Rationale

  > There's probably more detail than you want, but that can sometimes be a lifesaver (but log file growing rapidly on a very high-traffic sites).

  > Generally, the `error_log` directive is specified in the `main` context but you can specified inside a particular `server` or a `location` block, the global settings will be overridden and such `error_log` directive will set its own path to the log file and the level of logging.

  > It is possible to enable the debugging log for a particular IP address or a range of IP addresses (see examples).

  > The alternative method of storing the debug log is keep it in the memory (to a cyclic memory buffer). The memory buffer on the debug level does not have significant impact on performance even under high load.

  > If you want to logging of `ngx_http_rewrite_module` (at the `notice` level) you should enable `rewrite_log on;` in a `http`, `server`, or `location` contexts.

  > A while ago, I found this interesting comment:
  >
  > _`notice` is much better than `debug` as the error level for debugging rewrites because it will skip a lot of low-level irrelevant debug info (e.g. SSL or gzip details; 50+ lines per request)._

  > Words of caution:
  >
  >   - never leave debug logging to a file on in production
  >   - don't forget to revert debug-level for `error_log` on a very high traffic sites
  >   - absolutely use log rotation policy

###### Example

- Debugging log to a file:

  ```nginx
  # Turn on in a specific context, e.g.:
  #   - global    - for global logging
  #   - http      - for http and all locations logging
  #   - location  - for specific location
  error_log /var/log/nginx/error-debug.log debug;
  ```

- Debugging log to memory:

  ```nginx
  error_log memory:32m debug;
  ```

  > You can read more about that in the [Show debug log in memory](HELPERS.md#show-debug-log-in-memory) chapter.

- Debugging log for selected client connections:

  ```nginx
  events {

    # Other connections will use logging level set by the error_log directive.
    debug_connection    192.168.252.15/32;
    debug_connection    10.10.10.0/24;

  }
  ```

- Debugging log for each server:

  ```nginx
  error_log /var/log/nginx/debug.log debug;

  ...

  http {

    server {

      # To enable debugging:
      error_log /var/log/nginx/example.com/example.com-debug.log debug;
      # To disable debugging:
      error_log /var/log/nginx/example.com/example.com-debug.log;

      ...

    }

  }
  ```

#### :beginner: Improve debugging by disable daemon, master process, and all workers except one

###### Rationale

  > These directives with following values are mainly used during development and debugging, e.g. while testing a bug/feature.

  > For example, `daemon off;` and `master_process off;` lets me test configurations rapidly.

  > For normal production the NGINX server will start in the background (`daemon on;`). In this way NGINX and other services are running and talking to each other. One server runs many services.

  > In a development or debugging environment (you should never run NGINX in production with this), using `master_process off;`, I usually run NGINX in the foreground without the master process and press `^C` (`SIGINT`) to terminated it simply.

  > `worker_processes 1;` is also very useful because can reduce number of worker processes and the data they generate, so that is pretty comfortable for us to debug.

###### Example

```nginx
# Update configuration file (in a global context):
daemon            off
master_process    off;
worker_processes  1;

# Or run NGINX from shell (oneliner):
/usr/sbin/nginx -t -g 'daemon off; master_process off; worker_processes 1;'
```

###### External resources

- [Core functionality](https://nginx.org/en/docs/ngx_core_module.html)

#### :beginner: Use core dumps to figure out why NGINX keep crashing

###### Rationale

  > A core dump is basically a snapshot of the memory when the program crashed.

  > NGINX is a very stable daemon but sometimes it can happen that there is a unique termination of the running NGINX process.

  > It ensures two important directives that should be enabled if you want the memory dumps to be saved, however, in order to properly handle memory dumps, there are a few things to do. For fully information about it see [Dump a process's memory (from this handbook)](HELPERS.md#dump-a-processs-memory) chapter.

  > You should always enable core dumps when your NGINX instance receive an unexpected error or when it crashed.

###### Example

```nginx
worker_rlimit_core    500m;
worker_rlimit_nofile  65535;
working_directory     /var/dump/nginx;
```

#### :beginner: Use mirror module to copy requests to another backend

###### Rationale

  > Traffic mirroring is very useful to:
  >
  >   - analyze and debug original request
  >   - content inspection
  >   - troubleshooting (diagnose errors)
  >   - copy real traffic to a test envrionment without considerable changes to the production system

  > Mirroring itself doesnâ€™t affect original requests (only requests are analyzed, responses are not analyzed). And what's more, errors in the mirror backend donâ€™t affect the main backend.

  If you use mirroring, keep in mind:

  > _Delayed processing of the next request is a known side-effect of how mirroring is implemented in NGINX, and this is unlikely to change. The point was to make sure this was actually the case._
  >
  > _Usually a mirror subrequest does not affect the main request. However there are two issues with mirroring:_
  >
  >   _- the next request on the same connection will not be processed until all mirror subrequests finish. Try disabling keepalive for the primary location and see if it helps_
  >
  >   _- if you use `sendfile` and `tcp_nopush`, it's possible that the response is not pushed properly because of a mirror subrequest, which may result in a delay. Turn off `sendfile` and see if it helps_

###### Example

```nginx
location / {

  log_subrequest on;

  mirror /backend-mirror;
  mirror_request_body on;

  proxy_pass http://bk_web01;

  # Indicates whether the header fields of the original request
  # and original request body are passed to the proxied server:
  proxy_pass_request_headers on;
  proxy_pass_request_body on;

  # Uncomment if you have problems with latency:
  # keepalive_timeout 0;

}

location = /backend-mirror {

  internal;
  proxy_pass http://bk_web01_debug$request_uri;

  # Pass the headers that will be sent to the mirrored backend:
  proxy_set_header M-Server-Port $server_port;
  proxy_set_header M-Server-Addr $server_addr;
  proxy_set_header M-Host $host; # or $http_host for <host:port>
  proxy_set_header M-Real-IP $remote_addr;
  proxy_set_header M-Request-ID $request_id;
  proxy_set_header M-Original-URI $request_uri;

}
```

#### :beginner: Adjust worker processes

###### Rationale

  > The `worker_processes` directive is the sturdy spine of life for NGINX. This directive is responsible for letting our virtual server know many workers to spawn once it has become bound to the proper IP and port(s) and its value is helpful in CPU-intensive work.

  > The safest setting is to use the number of cores by passing `auto`. You can adjust this value to maximum throughput under high concurrency. The value should be changed to an optimal value depending on the number of cores available, disks, network subsystem, server load, and so on.

  > How many worker processes do you need? Do some multiple load testing. Hit the app hard and see what happens with only one. Then add some more to it and hit it again. At some point you'll reach a point of truly saturating the server resources. That's when you know you have the right balance.

  > In my opinion, for high load proxy servers (also standalone servers) interesting value is `ALL_CORES - 1` (or more) because if you're running NGINX with other critical services on the same server, you're just going to thrash the CPUs with all the context switching required to manage all of those processes.

  > Rule of thumb: If much time is spent blocked on I/O, worker processes should be increased further.

  > Increasing the number of worker processes is a great way to overcome a single CPU core bottleneck, but may opens a whole [new set of problems](https://blog.cloudflare.com/the-sad-state-of-linux-socket-balancing/).

  Official NGINX documentation say:

  > _When one is in doubt, setting it to the number of available CPU cores would be a good start (the value "auto" will try to autodetect it). [...] running one worker process per CPU core - makes the most efficient use of hardware resources._

###### Example

```nginx
# The safest and recommend way:
worker_processes auto;

# Alternative:
# VCPU = 4 , expr $(nproc --all) - 1, grep "processor" /proc/cpuinfo | wc -l
worker_processes 3;
```

#### :beginner: Use HTTP/2

###### Rationale

  > HTTP/2 will make our applications faster, simpler, and more robust. The primary goals for HTTP/2 are to reduce latency by enabling full request and response multiplexing, minimise protocol overhead via efficient compression of HTTP header fields, and add support for request prioritisation and server push.

  > `http2` directive configures the port to accept HTTP/2 connections. This doesn't mean it accepts only HTTP/2 connections. HTTP/2 is backwards-compatible with HTTP/1.1, so it would be possible to ignore it completely and everything will continue to work as before because if the client that does not support HTTP/2 will never ask the server for an HTTP/2 communication upgrade: the communication between them will be fully HTTP1/1.

  > Note that HTTP/2 multiplexes many requests within a single TCP connection. Typically, a single TCP connection is established to a server when HTTP/2 is in use.

  > You should also enable the `ssl` parameter (but NGINX can also be configured to accept HTTP/2 connections without SSL), required because browsers do not support HTTP/2 without encryption (the h2 specification, allows to use HTTP/2 over an unsecure `http://` scheme, but browsers have not implemented this (and most do not plan to)). Note that accepting HTTP/2 connections over TLS requires the "Application-Layer Protocol Negotiation" (ALPN) TLS extension support.

  > HTTP/2 has a extremely large [blacklist](https://http2.github.io/http2-spec/#BadCipherSuites) of old and insecure ciphers, so you should avoid them.

  > To test your server with [RFC 7540](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7540) <sup>[IETF]</sup> (HTTP/2) and [RFC 7541](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7541) <sup>[IETF]</sup> (HPACK) use [h2spec](https://github.com/summerwind/h2spec) tool.

  > Obviously, there is no pleasure without pain. There are serious vulnerabilities detected in the HTTP/2 protocol. For more information please see [HTTP/2 can shut you down!](https://www.secpod.com/blog/http2-dos-vulnerabilities/), [On the recent HTTP/2 DoS attacks](https://blog.cloudflare.com/on-the-recent-http-2-dos-attacks/), and [HTTP/2: In-depth analysis of the top four flaws of the next generation web protocol](https://www.imperva.com/docs/Imperva_HII_HTTP2.pdf) <sup>[pdf]</sup>.

  > Let's not forget about backwards-compatible with HTTP/1.1, also when it comes to security. Many of the vulnerabilities for HTTP/1.1 may be present in HTTP/2.

###### Example

```nginx
server {

  listen 10.240.20.2:443 ssl http2;

  ...
```

#### :beginner: Maintaining SSL sessions

###### Rationale

  > Enabling session caching helps to reduce NGINX server CPU load. This also improves performance from the clientsâ€™ perspective because it eliminates the need for a new (and time-consuming) SSL handshake to be conducted each time a request is made.

  > The TLS RFC recommends that sessions are not kept alive for more than 24 hours (it is the maximum time). But a while ago, I found `ssl_session_timeout` with less time (e.g. 15 minutes) for prevent abused by advertisers like Google and Facebook, I don't know, I guess it makes sense.

  > Default, "built-in" session cache is not optimal as it can be used by only one worker process and can cause memory fragmentation. It is much better to use shared cache.

  > When using `ssl_session_cache`, the performance of keep-alive connections over SSL might be enormously increased. 10M value of this is a good starting point (1MB shared cache can hold approximately 4,000 sessions). With `shared` a cache shared between all worker processes (a cache with the same name can be used in several virtual servers).

  > Most servers do not purge sessions or ticket keys, thus increasing the risk that a server compromise would leak data from previous (and future) connections.

  [Ivan RistiÄ‡](https://twitter.com/ivanristic) (Founder of Hardenize) say:

  > _Session resumption either creates a large server-side cache that can be broken into or, with tickets, kills forward secrecy. So you have to balance performance (you don't want your users to use full handshakes on every connection) and security (you don't want to compromise it too much). Different projects dictate different settings. [...] One reason not to use a very large cache (just because you can) is that popular implementations don't actually delete any records from there; even the expired sessions are still in the cache and can be recovered. The only way to really delete is to overwrite them with a new session. [...] These days I'd probably reduce the maximum session duration to 4 hours, down from 24 hours currently in my book. But that's largely based on a gut feeling that 4 hours is enough for you to reap the performance benefits, and using a shorter lifetime is always better._

  [Ilya Grigorik](https://www.igvita.com/) (Web performance engineer at Google) say about SSL buffers:

  > _1400 bytes (actually, it should probably be even a bit lower) is the recommended setting for interactive traffic where you want to avoid any unnecessary delays due to packet loss/jitter of fragments of the TLS record. However, packing each TLS record into dedicated packet does add some framing overhead and you probably want larger record sizes if you're streaming larger (and less latency sensitive) data. 4K is an in between value that's "reasonable" but not great for either case. For smaller records, we should also reserve space for various TCP options (timestamps, SACKs. up to 40 bytes), and account for TLS record overhead (another 20-60 bytes on average, depending on the negotiated ciphersuite). All in all: 1500 - 40 (IP) - 20 (TCP) - 40 (TCP options) - TLS overhead (60-100) ~= 1300 bytes. If you inspect records emitted by Google servers, you'll see that they carry ~1300 bytes of application data due to the math above._

  The recommendation from Leif Hedstrom, Thomas Jackson, Brian Geffon etc is to use the below values:

  > - smaller TLS record size: MTU/MSS (1500) minus the TCP (20 bytes) and IP (40 bytes) overheads: 1500 - 40 - 20 = 1440 bytes<br>
  > - larger TLS record size: maximum TLS record size which is 16383 (2^14 - 1)

###### Example

```nginx
ssl_session_cache   shared:NGX_SSL_CACHE:10m;
ssl_session_timeout 12h;
ssl_session_tickets off;
ssl_buffer_size     1400;
```

#### :beginner: Use exact names in a `server_name` directive where possible

###### Rationale

  > Exact names, wildcard names starting with an asterisk, and wildcard names ending with an asterisk are stored in three hash tables bound to the listen ports.

  > The exact names hash table is searched first. If a name is not found, the hash table with wildcard names starting with an asterisk is searched. If the name is not found there, the hash table with wildcard names ending with an asterisk is searched. Searching wildcard names hash table is slower than searching exact names hash table because names are searched by domain parts.

  > Regular expressions are tested sequentially and therefore are the slowest method and are non-scalable. For these reasons, it is better to use exact names where possible.

###### Example

```nginx
# It is more efficient to define them explicitly:
server {

    listen       192.168.252.10:80;

    server_name  example.org www.example.org *.example.org;

    ...

}

# Than to use the simplified form:
server {

    listen       192.168.252.10:80;

    server_name  .example.org;

    ...

}
```

###### External resources

- [Virtual server logic](NGINX_BASICS.md#virtual-server-logic)

#### :beginner: Avoid checks `server_name` with `if` directive

###### Rationale

  > When NGINX receives a request no matter what is the subdomain being requested, be it `www.example.com` or just the plain `example.com` this `if` directive is always evaluated. Since youâ€™re requesting NGINX to check for the `Host` header for every request. Itâ€™s extremely inefficient.

  > Instead use two server directives like the example below. This approach decreases NGINX processing requirements.

  > The problem is not just the `$server_name` directive. Keep in mind also other variables, e.g. `$scheme`. In some cases (but not always), it is better to add an additional a block directive than to use the `if`.

###### Example

Not recommended configuration:

```nginx
server {

  server_name                 example.com www.example.com;

  if ($host = www.example.com) {

    return                    301 https://example.com$request_uri;

  }

  server_name                 example.com;

  ...

}
```

Recommended configuration:

```nginx
server {

    server_name               www.example.com;

    return                    301 $scheme://example.com$request_uri;

    # If you force your web traffic to use HTTPS:
    # return                  301 https://example.com$request_uri;

    ...

}

server {

    listen                    192.168.252.10:80;

    server_name               example.com;

    ...

}
```

#### :beginner: Use `$request_uri` to avoid using regular expressions

###### Rationale

  > With built-in `$request_uri` we can effectively avoid doing any capturing or matching at all. By default, the regex is costly and will slow down the performance.

  > This rule is addressing passing the URL unchanged to a new host, sure return is more efficient just passing through the existing URI.

  > The value of `$request_uri` is always the original URI (full original request URI with arguments) as received from the client and is not subject to any normalisations compared to the `$uri` directive.

  > Use `$request_uri` in a map directive, if you need to match the URI and its query string.

  > An unconsidered use the `$request_uri` can lead to many strange behaviors. For example, using `$request_uri` in the wrong place can cause URL encoded characters to become doubly encoded. So the most of the time you would use `$uri`, because it is normalised.

  I think the best explanation comes from the official documentation:

  > _Donâ€™t feel bad here, itâ€™s easy to get confused with regular expressions. In fact, itâ€™s so easy to do that we should make an effort to keep them neat and clean._

###### Example

Not recommended configuration:

```nginx
# 1)
rewrite ^/(.*)$ https://example.com/$1 permanent;

# 2)
rewrite ^ https://example.com$request_uri permanent;
```

Recommended configuration:

```nginx
return 301 https://example.com$request_uri;
```

#### :beginner: Use `try_files` directive to ensure a file exists

###### Rationale

  > `try_files` is definitely a very useful thing. You can use `try_files` directive to check a file exists in a specified order.

  > You should use `try_files` instead of `if` directive. It's definitely better way than using `if` for this action because `if` directive is extremely inefficient since it is evaluated every time for every request.

  > The advantage of using `try_files` is that the behavior switches immediately with one command. I think the code is more readable also.

  > `try_files` allows you:
  >
  > - to check if the file exists from a predefined list
  > - to check if the file exists from a specified directory
  > - to use an internal redirect if none of the files are found

###### Example

Not recommended configuration:

```nginx

  ...

  root /var/www/example.com;

  location /images {

    if (-f $request_filename) {

      expires 30d;
      break;

    }

  ...

}
```

Recommended configuration:

```nginx

  ...

  root /var/www/example.com;

  location /images {

    try_files $uri =404;

  ...

}
```

#### :beginner: Use `return` directive instead of `rewrite` for redirects

###### Rationale

  > You should use `server` blocks and `return` statements as they're way simpler and faster than evaluating RegEx via `location` blocks. This directive stops processing and returns the specified code to a client.

  > If you have a scenario where you need to validate the URL with a regex or need to capture elements in the original URL (that are obviously not in a corresponding NGINX variable), then you should use `rewrite`.

###### Example

Not recommended configuration:

```nginx
server {

  ...

  if ($host = api.example.com) {

    rewrite     ^/(.*)$ http://example.com/$1 permanent;

  }

  ...
```

Recommended configuration:

```nginx
server {

  ...

  if ($host = api.example.com) {

    return      403;

    # or other examples:
    #   return    301 https://example.com$request_uri;
    #   return    301 $scheme://$host$request_uri;

  }

```

#### :beginner: Enable PCRE JIT to speed up processing of regular expressions

###### Rationale

  > Enables the use of JIT for regular expressions to speed-up their processing.

  > By compiling NGINX with the PCRE library, you can perform complex manipulations with your `location` blocks and use the powerful `rewrite` directives.

  > PCRE JIT can speed up processing of regular expressions significantly. NGINX with `pcre_jit` is magnitudes faster than without it. This option can improve performance, however, in some cases `pcre_jit` may have a negative effect. So, before enabling it, I recommend you to read this great document: [PCRE Performance Project](https://zherczeg.github.io/sljit/pcre.html).

  > If youâ€™ll try to use `pcre_jit on;` without JIT available, or if NGINX was compiled with JIT available, but currently loaded PCRE library does not support JIT, will warn you during configuration parsing.

  > The `--with-pcre-jit` is only needed when you compile PCRE library using NGNIX configure (`./configure --with-pcre=`). When using a system PCRE library whether or not JIT is supported depends on how the library was compiled.

  From NGINX documentation:

  > _The JIT is available in PCRE libraries starting from version 8.20 built with the `--enable-jit` configuration parameter. When the PCRE library is built with nginx (`--with-pcre=`), the JIT support is enabled via the `--with-pcre-jit` configuration parameter._

  > But if you don't pass `--with-pcre-jit`, the NGINX configure scripts are smart enough to detect and enable it automatically. See [here](http://hg.nginx.org/nginx/file/abd40ce603fa/auto/lib/pcre/conf). So, if your PCRE library is recent enough, a simple `./configure` with no switches will compile NGINX with `pcre_jit` enabled.

###### Example

```nginx
# In global context:
pcre_jit on;
```

###### External resources

- [Core functionality - pcre jit](https://nginx.org/en/docs/ngx_core_module.html#pcre_jit)

#### :beginner: Activate the cache for connections to upstream servers

###### Rationale

  > The idea behind keepalive is to address the latency of establishing TCP connections over high-latency networks. This connection cache is useful in situations where NGINX has to constantly maintain a certain number of open connections to an upstream server.

  > Keep-Alive connections can have a major impact on performance by reducing the CPU and network overhead needed to open and close connections. With HTTP keepalive enabled in NGINX upstream servers reduces latency thus improves performance and it reduces the possibility that the NGINX runs out of ephemeral ports.

  > This can greatly reduce the number of new TCP connections, as NGINX can now reuse its existing connections (`keepalive`) per upstream.

  > If your upstream server supports Keep-Alive in its config, NGINX will now reuse existing TCP connections without creating new ones. This can greatly reduce the number of sockets in `TIME_WAIT` TCP connections on a busy servers (less work for OS to establish new connections, less packets on a network).

  > Keep-Alive connections are only supported as of HTTP/1.1.

###### Example

```nginx
# Upstream context:
upstream backend {

  # Sets the maximum number of idle keepalive connections to upstream servers
  # that are preserved in the cache of each worker process.
  keepalive           16;

}

# Server/location contexts:
server {

  ...

  location / {

    # By default only talks HTTP/1 to the upstream,
    # keepalive is only enabled in HTTP/1.1:
    proxy_http_version  1.1;
    # Remove the Connection header if the client sends it,
    # it could be "close" to close a keepalive connection:
    proxy_set_header    Connection "";

    ...

  }

}
```

#### :beginner: Make an exact location match to speed up the selection process

###### Rationale

  > Exact location matches are often used to speed up the selection process by immediately ending the execution of the algorithm.

###### Example

```nginx
# Matches the query / only and stops searching:
location = / {

  ...

}

# Matches the query /v9 only and stops searching:
location = /v9 {

  ...

}

...

# Matches any query due to the fact that all queries begin at /,
# but regular expressions and any longer conventional blocks will be matched at first place:
location / {

  ...

}
```

###### External resources

- [Untangling the nginx location block matching algorithm](https://artfulrobot.uk/blog/untangling-nginx-location-block-matching-algorithm)

#### :beginner: Use `limit_conn` to improve limiting the download speed

###### Rationale

  > NGINX provides two directives to limiting download speed:
  >   - `limit_rate_after` - sets the amount of data transferred before the `limit_rate` directive takes effect
  >   - `limit_rate` - allows you to limit the transfer rate of individual client connections (past exceeding `limit_rate_after`)

  > This solution limits NGINX download speed per connection, so, if one user opens multiple e.g. video files, it will be able to download `X * the number of times` he connected to the video files.

  > To prevent this situation use `limit_conn_zone` and `limit_conn` directives.

###### Example

```nginx
# Create limit connection zone:
limit_conn_zone $binary_remote_addr zone=conn_for_remote_addr:1m;

# Add rules to limiting the download speed:
limit_rate_after 1m;  # run at maximum speed for the first 1 megabyte
limit_rate 250k;      # and set rate limit after 1 megabyte

# Enable queue:
location /videos {

  # Max amount of data by one client: 10 megabytes (limit_rate_after * 10)
  limit_conn conn_for_remote_addr 10;

  ...
```

#### :beginner: Always keep NGINX up-to-date

###### Rationale

  > NGINX is a very secure and stable but vulnerabilities in the main binary itself do pop up from time to time. It's the main reason for keep NGINX up-to-date as hard as you can.

  > When planning the NGINX update/upgrade process, the best way is simply to install the newly released version. But for me, the most common way to handle NGINX updates is to wait a few weeks after the stable release (and reading community comments about all issues after the release of the new NGINX version).

  > Most modern GNU/Linux distros will not push the latest version of NGINX into their default package lists so maybe you should consider install it from sources.

  > Before update/upgrade NGINX remember about:
  >   - do it on the testing environment in the first place
  >   - make sure to make a backup of your current configuration before updating

###### Example

```bash
# RedHat/CentOS
yum install <pkgname>

# Debian/Ubuntu
apt-get install <pkgname>

# FreeBSD/OpenBSD
pkg -f install <pkgname>
```

#### :beginner: Run as an unprivileged user

###### Rationale

  > It is an important general principle that programs have the minimal amount of privileges necessary to do its job. That way, if the program is broken, its damage is limited. The most extreme example is to simply not write a secure program at all - if this can be done, it usually should be.

  > There is no real difference in security just by changing the process owner name. On the other hand, in security, the principle of least privilege states that an entity should be given no more permission than necessary to accomplish its goals within a given system. This way only master process runs as root.

  > NGINX meets these requirements and it is the default behaviour, but remember to check it.

###### Example

```bash
# Edit/check nginx.conf:
user nginx;   # or 'www' for example; if group is omitted,
              # a group whose name equals that of user is used

# Set owner and group for root (app, default) directory:
chown -R nginx:nginx /var/www/example.com
```

#### :beginner: Disable unnecessary modules

###### Rationale

  > It is recommended to disable any modules which are not required as this will minimise the risk of any potential attacks by limiting the operations allowed by the web server.

  > Disable unneeded modules in order to reduce the memory utilized and improve performance. Modules that are not needed just make loading times longer.

  > The best way to unload unused modules is use the `configure` option during installation. If you have static linking a shared module you should re-compile NGINX.

  Use only high quality modules and remember about that:

  > _Unfortunately, many thirdâ€‘party modules use blocking calls, and users (and sometimes even the developers of the modules) arenâ€™t aware of the drawbacks. Blocking operations can ruin NGINX performance and must be avoided at all costs._

###### Example

```nginx
# 1) During installation:
./configure --without-http_autoindex_module

# 2) Comment modules in the configuration file e.g. modules.conf:
# load_module                 /usr/share/nginx/modules/ndk_http_module.so;
# load_module                 /usr/share/nginx/modules/ngx_http_auth_pam_module.so;
# load_module                 /usr/share/nginx/modules/ngx_http_cache_purge_module.so;
# load_module                 /usr/share/nginx/modules/ngx_http_dav_ext_module.so;
load_module                   /usr/share/nginx/modules/ngx_http_echo_module.so;
# load_module                 /usr/share/nginx/modules/ngx_http_fancyindex_module.so;
load_module                   /usr/share/nginx/modules/ngx_http_geoip_module.so;
load_module                   /usr/share/nginx/modules/ngx_http_headers_more_filter_module.so;
# load_module                 /usr/share/nginx/modules/ngx_http_image_filter_module.so;
# load_module                 /usr/share/nginx/modules/ngx_http_lua_module.so;
load_module                   /usr/share/nginx/modules/ngx_http_perl_module.so;
# load_module                 /usr/share/nginx/modules/ngx_mail_module.so;
# load_module                 /usr/share/nginx/modules/ngx_nchan_module.so;
# load_module                 /usr/share/nginx/modules/ngx_stream_module.so;

#### :beginner: Protect sensitive resources

###### Rationale

  > Hidden directories and files should never be web accessible - sometimes critical data are published during application deploy. If you use control version system you should defninitely drop the access to the critical hidden directories like a `.git` or `.svn` to prevent expose source code of your application.

  > Sensitive resources contains items that abusers can use to fully recreate the source code used by the site and look for bugs, vulnerabilities, and exposed passwords.

  As for the denying method:

  > In my opinion, a return 403 (or even a 404, as the [RFC2616 - 10.4.4 403 Forbidden](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616#section-10.4.4) <sup>[IETF]</sup> suggests for purposes of no information disclosure) is less error prone if you know the resource should under no circumstances be accessed via http, even if "authorized" in a general context.

  Note also this:

  > NGINX process request in phases. `return` directive is from rewrite module, and `deny` is from access module. Rewrite module is processed in `NGX_HTTP_REWRITE_PHASE` phase (for `return` in `location` context), the access module is processed in `NGX_HTTP_ACCESS_PHASE` phase, rewrite phase (where `return` belongs) happens before access phase (where `deny` works), thus `return` stops request processing and returns 301 in rewrite phase.

  > `deny all` will have the same consequence but leaves the possibilities of slip-ups. The issue is illustrated in [this](https://serverfault.com/questions/748320/protecting-a-location-by-ip-while-applying-basic-auth-everywhere-else/748373#748373) answer, suggesting not using the `satisfy` + `allow` + `deny` at `server { ... }` level because of inheritance.

  > On the other hand, according to the NGINX documentation: _The `ngx_http_access_module` module allows limiting access to certain client addresses._ More specifically, you can't restrict access to another module (`return` is more used when you want to return other codes, not block access).

###### Example

```nginx
if ($request_uri ~ "/\.git") {

  return 403;

}

# or
location ~ /\.git {

  deny all;

}

# or
location ~* ^.*(\.(?:git|svn|htaccess))$ {

  return 403;

}

# or all . directories/files excepted .well-known
location ~ /\.(?!well-known\/) {

  deny all;
  access_log /var/log/nginx/hidden-files.log main;

}

# Think also about the following rule (I haven't tested this but looks interesting). It comes from:
#   - https://github.com/h5bp/server-configs-nginx/blob/master/h5bp/location/security_file_access.conf
location ~* (?:#.*#|\.(?:bak|conf|dist|fla|in[ci]|log|orig|psd|sh|sql|sw[op])|~)$ {

  deny all;

}

# Based on the above (tested):
location ~* ^.*(\.(?:git|svn|bak|conf|dist|in[ci]|log|orig|sh|sql|sw[op]|htaccess))$ {

  deny all;
  access_log /var/log/nginx/restricted-files.log main;

}
```

#### :beginner: Hide Nginx version number

###### Rationale

  > Disclosing the version of NGINX running can be undesirable, particularly in environments sensitive to information disclosure.

  > This information can be used as a starting point for attackers who know of specific vulnerabilities associated with specific versions. For example, Shodan provides a widely used database of this info. It's far more efficient to just try the vulnerability on all random servers than asking them.

  > Hiding your version information will not stop an attack from happening, but it will make you less of a target if attackers are looking for a specific version of hardware or software. I take the data broadcast by the HTTP server as a personal information.

  > Security by obscurity doesn't mean you're safe, but it does slow people down sometimes, and that's exactly what's needed for day zero vulnerabilities.

  Maybe it's a very restrictive approach but the guidelines from [RFC 2616 - 15.1 Personal Information](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616#section-15.1) are always very helpful to me:

  > _History shows that errors in this area often create serious security and/or privacy problems and generate highly adverse publicity for the implementor's company. [...] Like any generic data transfer protocol, HTTP cannot regulate the content of the data that is transferred, nor is there any a priori method of determining the sensitivity of any particular piece of information within the context of any given request. Therefore, applications SHOULD supply as much control over this information as possible to the provider of that information. Four header fields are worth special mention in this context: `Server`, `Via`, `Referer` and `From`._

###### Example

```nginx
# This disables emitting NGINX version on error pages and in the "Server" response header field:
server_tokens off;
```

- [Fingerprint Web Server (OTG-INFO-002)](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Fingerprint_Web_Server_(OTG-INFO-002))

#### :beginner: Hide Nginx server signature

###### Rationale

  > The `Server` response-header field contains information about the software used by the origin server to handle the request. This string is used by places like Alexa and Netcraft to collect statistics about how many and of what type of web server are live on the Internet.

  > One of the easiest first steps to undertake, is to prevent the web server from showing its used software via the server header. Certainly, there are several reasons why you would like to change the server header. It could be security, it could be redundant systems, load balancers etc.

  > And in my opinion, there is no real reason or need to show this much information about your server. It is easy to look up particular vulnerabilities once you know the version number. However, it's not information you need to give out, so I am generally in favour of removing it, where this can be accomplished with minimal effort.

  > You should compile NGINX from sources with `ngx_headers_more` to used `more_set_headers` directive or use a [nginx-remove-server-header.patch](https://gitlab.com/buik/nginx/blob/master/nginx-remove-server-header.patch).

  The Official Apache Documentation (yep, it's not a joke, in my opinion that's an interesting point of view) say:

  > _Setting ServerTokens to less than minimal is not recommended because it makes it more difficult to debug interoperational problems. Also note that disabling the Server: header does nothing at all to make your server more secure. The idea of "security through obscurity" is a myth and leads to a false sense of safety._

###### Example

```nginx
more_set_headers "Server: Unknown"; # or whatever else, e.g. 'WOULDN'T YOU LIKE TO KNOW!'

# or:
more_clear_headers 'Server';
```

#### :beginner: Hide upstream proxy headers

###### Rationale

  > Securing a server goes far beyond not showing what's running but I think less is more is better.

  > When NGINX is used to proxy requests to an upstream server (such as a PHP-FPM instance), it can be beneficial to hide certain headers sent in the upstream response (e.g. the version of PHP running).

###### Example

```nginx
proxy_hide_header X-Powered-By;
proxy_hide_header X-AspNetMvc-Version;
proxy_hide_header X-AspNet-Version;
proxy_hide_header X-Drupal-Cache;
```

- [Set the HTTP headers with add_header and proxy_*_header directives properly (from this handbook)](#beginner-set-the-http-headers-with-add_header-and-proxy__header-directives-properly)

#### :beginner: Remove support for legacy and risky HTTP headers

###### Rationale

  > In my opinion, support of these headers is not a vulnerability itself, but more like misconfiguration which in some circumstances could lead to a vulnerability.

  > It is good manners to definitely remove (or stripping/normalizing of their values) support for risky HTTP request headers. None of them never should get to your application or go through a proxy server without not factor the contents of them.

  > The ability to use of the `X-Original-URL` or `X-Rewrite-URL` can have serious consequences. These headers allows a user to access one URL but have your app (e.g. uses PHP/Symfony) return a different one which can bypass restrictions on higher level caches and web servers, for example, also if you set a deny rule (`deny all; return 403;`) on the proxy for location such as `/admin`.

  > If one or more of your backends uses the contents of the `X-Forwarded-Host`, `X-Rewrite-Url` or `X-Original-Url` HTTP request headers to decide which of your users (or which security domain) it sends an HTTP response, you may be impacted by this class of vulnerability. If you passes these headers to your backend an attacker could potentially cause to store a response with arbitrary content inserted to a victimâ€™s cache.

  Look at the following explanation taken from [PortSwigger Research - Practical Web Cache Poisoning](https://portswigger.net/research/practical-web-cache-poisoning):

  > _This revealed the headers `X-Original-URL` and `X-Rewrite-URL` which override the request's path. I first noticed them affecting targets running Drupal, and digging through Drupal's code revealed that the support for this header comes from the popular PHP framework Symfony, which in turn took the code from Zend. The end result is that a huge number of PHP applications unwittingly support these headers. Before we try using these headers for cache poisoning, I should point out they're also great for bypassing WAFs and security rules [...]_

###### Example

```nginx
# Remove risky headers (the safest method):
proxy_set_header X-Original-URL "";
proxy_set_header X-Rewrite-URL "";

# Or consider setting the vulnerable headers to a known-safe value or unsetting the header:
proxy_set_header X-Original-URL $request_uri;
proxy_set_header X-Rewrite-URL $original_uri;
proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Host $host;
```

#### :beginner: Use only the latest supported OpenSSL version

###### Rationale

  > Before start see [Release Strategy Policies](https://www.openssl.org/policies/releasestrat.html) and [Changelog](https://www.openssl.org/news/changelog.html) on the OpenSSL website. Criteria for choosing OpenSSL version can vary and it depends all on your use.

  > The latest versions of the major OpenSSL library are (may be changed):
  >
  >   - the next version of OpenSSL will be 3.0.0
  >   - version 1.1.1 will be supported until 2023-09-11 (LTS)
  >     - last minor version: 1.1.1d (September 10, 2019)
  >   - version 1.1.0 will be supported until 2019-09-11
  >     - last minor version: 1.1.0k (May 28, 2018)
  >   - version 1.0.2 will be supported until 2019-12-31 (LTS)
  >     - last minor version: 1.0.2s (May 28, 2018)
  >   - any other versions are no longer supported

  > In my opinion, the only safe way is based on the up-to-date, still supported and production-ready version of the OpenSSL. And what's more, I recommend to hang on to the latest versions (e.g. 1.1.1 or 1.1.1d at this moment).

  > You should know one thing before start using OpenSSL 1.1.1: it has a different API than the current 1.0.2 so that's not just a simple flick of the switch. NGINX started supporting TLS 1.3 with the release of version 1.13.0, but when the OpenSSL devs released OpenSSL 1.1.1, that NGINX had support for the brand new protocol version.

  > If your repositories system does not have the newest OpenSSL, you can do the [compilation](https://github.com/trimstray/nginx-admins-handbook#installing-from-source) process (see OpenSSL sub-section).

  > I also recommend track the [OpenSSL Vulnerabilities](https://www.openssl.org/news/vulnerabilities.html) official newsletter, if you want to know a security bugs and issues fixed in OpenSSL.

#### :beginner: Force all connections over TLS

###### Rationale

  > TLS provides two main services. For one, it validates the identity of the server that the user is connecting to for the user. It also protects the transmission of sensitive information from the user to the server.

  > In my opinion you should always use HTTPS instead of HTTP (use HTTP only for redirection to HTTPS) to protect your website, even if it doesnâ€™t handle sensitive communications and donâ€™t have any mixed content. The application can have many sensitive places that should be protected.

  > Always put login page, registration forms, all subsequent authenticated pages, contact forms, and payment details forms in HTTPS to prevent injection and sniffing. Them must be accessed only over TLS to ensure your traffic is secure.

  > If page is available over TLS, it must be composed completely of content which is transmitted over TLS. Requesting subresources using the insecure HTTP protocol weakens the security of the entire page and HTTPS protocol. Modern browsers should blocked or report all active mixed content delivered via HTTP on pages by default.

  > Also remember to implement the [HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS)](#beginner-enable-http-strict-transport-security).

  > We have currently the first free and open CA - [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) - so generating and implementing certificates has never been so easy. It was created to provide free and easy-to-use TLS and SSL certificates.

###### Example

- force all traffic to use TLS:

  ```nginx
  server {

    listen 10.240.20.2:80;

    server_name example.com;

    return 301 https://$host$request_uri;

  }

  server {

    listen 10.240.20.2:443 ssl;

    server_name example.com;

    ...

  }
  ```

- force login page to use TLS:

  ```nginx
  server {

    listen 10.240.20.2:80;

    server_name example.com;

    ...

    location ^~ /login {

      return 301 https://example.com$request_uri;

    }

  }
  ```

#### :beginner: Use min. 2048-bit private keys

###### Rationale

  > The truth is, the industry/community are split on this topic. I am in the "_use 2048, because 4096 gives us almost nothing, while costing us quite a lot_" camp myself.

  > Advisories recommend 2048 for now. Security experts are projecting that 2048 bits will be sufficient for commercial use until around the year 2030 (as per [NIST](https://www.keylength.com/en/4/)). The latest version of FIPS-186 also say the U.S. Federal Government generate (and use) digital signatures with 1024, 2048, or 3072 bit key lengths.

  > Generally there is no compelling reason to choose 4096 bit keys over 2048 provided you use sane expiration intervals. While it is true that a longer key provides better security, doubling the length of the key from 2048 to 4096, the increase in bits of security is only 18, a mere 16% (the time to sign a message increases by 7x, and the time to verify a signature increases by more than 3x in some cases). Moreover, besides requiring more storage, longer keys also translate into increased CPU usage and higher power consumption.

  > The real advantage of using a 4096-bit key nowadays is future proofing. If you want to get **A+ with 100%s on SSL Lab** (for Key Exchange) you should definitely use 4096 bit private keys. That's the main (and the only one for me) reason why you should use them.

  > Longer keys take more time to generate and require more CPU and power when used for encrypting and decrypting, also the SSL handshake at the start of each connection will be slower. It also has a small impact on the client side (e.g. browsers).

  > Use OpenSSL's `speed` command to benchmark the two types and compare results, e.g. `openssl speed rsa2048 rsa4096` or `openssl speed rsa`. Remember, however, in OpenSSL speed tests you see difference on block cipher speed, while in real life most CPU time is spent on asymmetric algorithms during SSL handshake. On the other hand, modern processors are capable of executing at least 1k of RSA 1024-bit signs per second on a single core, so this isn't usually an issue.

  > Use of alternative solution: [ECC Certificate Signing Request (CSR)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic-curve_cryptography) - `ECDSA` certificates (are recommended over `RSA` certificates) contain an `ECC` public key. `ECC` keys are better than `RSA & DSA` keys in that the `ECC` algorithm is harder to break. NGINX supports dual certificates, so you can get the leaner, meaner `ECC` certificates but still let visitors with older browsers browse your Web site.

  The "SSL/TLS Deployment Best Practices" book say:

  > _The cryptographic handshake, which is used to establish secure connections, is an operation whose cost is highly influenced by private key size. Using a key that is too short is insecure, but using a key that is too long will result in "too much" security and slow operation. For most web sites, using RSA keys stronger than 2048 bits and ECDSA keys stronger than 256 bits is a waste of CPU power and might impair user experience. Similarly, there is little benefit to increasing the strength of the ephemeral key exchange beyond 2048 bits for DHE and 256 bits for ECDHE._

  Konstantin Ryabitsev (Reddit):

  > _Generally speaking, if we ever find ourselves in a world where 2048-bit keys are no longer good enough, it won't be because of improvements in brute-force capabilities of current computers, but because RSA will be made obsolete as a technology due to revolutionary computing advances. If that ever happens, 3072 or 4096 bits won't make much of a difference anyway. This is why anything above 2048 bits is generally regarded as a sort of feel-good hedging theatre._

  **My recommendation:**

  > Use 2048-bit key instead of 4096-bit at this moment.

###### Example

```bash
### Example (RSA):
( _fd="example.com.key" ; _len="2048" ; openssl genrsa -out ${_fd} ${_len} )

# Let's Encrypt:
certbot certonly -d example.com -d www.example.com --rsa-key-size 2048

### Example (ECC):
# _curve: prime256v1, secp521r1, secp384r1
( _fd="example.com.key" ; _fd_csr="example.com.csr" ; _curve="prime256v1" ; \

  > It is recommended to enable TLS 1.2/1.3 and fully disable SSLv2, SSLv3, TLS 1.0 and TLS 1.1 that have protocol weaknesses and uses older cipher suites (do not provide any modern ciper modes) which we really shouldnâ€™t be using anymore. By the way, the TLS 1.3 protocol is the latest and more robust TLS protocol version and should be used where possible (and where don't need backward compatibility). The biggest benefit to dropping TLS 1.0 and 1.1 is that modern AEAD ciphers are only supported by TLS 1.2 and above.

  > TLS 1.0 and TLS 1.1 must not be used (see [Deprecating TLSv1.0 and TLSv1.1](https://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-moriarty-tls-oldversions-diediedie-00.html) <sup>[IETF]</sup>) and were superceded by TLS 1.2, which has now itself been superceded by TLS 1.3 (must be included by January 1, 2024). They are also actively being deprecated in accordance with guidance from government agencies (e.g. NIST Special Publication (SP) [800-52 Revision 2](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-52r2.pdf) <sup>[NIST]</sup>) and industry consortia such as the Payment Card Industry Association (PCI) [PCI-TLS - Migrating from SSL and Early TLS (Information Suplement)](https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/documents/Migrating-from-SSL-Early-TLS-Info-Supp-v1_1.pdf).

  > TLS 1.2 and TLS 1.3 are both without security issues. Only these versions provides modern cryptographic algorithms. TLS 1.3 is a new TLS version that will power a faster and more secure web for the next few years. What's more, TLS 1.3 comes without a ton of stuff (was removed): renegotiation, compression, and many legacy algorithms: `DSA`, `RC4`, `SHA1`, `MD5`, and `CBC` ciphers. TLS 1.0 and TLS 1.1 protocols will be removed from browsers at the beginning of 2020.

  > TLS 1.2 does require careful configuration to ensure obsolete cipher suites with identified vulnerabilities are not used in conjunction with it. TLS 1.3 removes the need to make these decisions and doesn't require any particular configuration, as all of the ciphers are secure, and by default OpenSSL only enables `GCM` and `Chacha20/Poly1305` for TLSv1.3, without enabling `CCM`. TLS 1.3 version also improves TLS 1.2 security, privace and performance issues.

  > Before enabling specific protocol version, you should check which ciphers are supported by the protocol. So, if you turn on TLS 1.2 and TLS 1.3 both remember about [the correct (and strong)](#beginner-use-only-strong-ciphers) ciphers to handle them. Otherwise, they will not be anyway works without supported ciphers (no TLS handshake will succeed).

  > I think the best way to deploy secure configuration is: enable TLS 1.2 (is safe enough) without any `CBC` ciphers and/or TLS 1.3 which is safer because of its handling improvement and the exclusion of everything that went obsolete since TLS 1.2 came up. So, making TLS 1.2 your "minimum protocol level" is the solid choice and an industry best practice (all of industry standards like PCI-DSS, HIPAA, NIST, strongly suggest the use of TLS 1.2 than TLS 1.1/1.0).

  > TLS 1.2 is probably insufficient for legacy client support. The NIST guidelines are not applicable to all use cases, and you should always analyze your user base before deciding which protocols to support or drop (for example, by adding variables responsible for TLS versions and ciphers to the log format). It's important to remember that not every client supports the latest and greatest that TLS has to offer.

  > If you told NGINX to use TLS 1.3, it will use TLS 1.3 only where is available. NGINX supports TLS 1.3 since version 1.13.0 (released in April 2017), when built against OpenSSL 1.1.1 or more.

  > For TLS 1.3, think about using [`ssl_early_data`](#beginner-prevent-replay-attacks-on-zero-round-trip-time) to allow TLS 1.3 0-RTT handshakes.

  **My recommendation:**

  > Use only [TLSv1.3 and TLSv1.2](#keep-only-tls1.2-tls13).

#### :beginner: Use only strong ciphers

###### Rationale

  > This parameter changes quite often, the recommended configuration for today may be out of date tomorrow. In my opinion, in case of doubt, you should follow [Mozilla Security/Server Side TLS](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Security/Server_Side_TLS) (it's really great source; all Mozilla websites and deployments should follow the recommendations from this document).

  > To check ciphers supported by OpenSSL on your server: `openssl ciphers -s -v`, `openssl ciphers -s -v ECDHE` or `openssl ciphers -s -v DHE`.

  > Without careful cipher suite selection (TLS 1.3 does it for you!), you risk negotiating to an insecure cipher suite that may be compromised. If another party doesn't support a cipher suite that's up to your standards, and you highly value security on that connection, you shouldn't allow your system to operate with lower-quality cipher suites.

  > For more security use only strong and not vulnerable cipher suites. Place `ECDHE` and `DHE` suites at the top of your list (also if you are concerned about performance, prioritize `ECDHE-ECDSA` over `DHE`; Chrome is going to prioritize `ECDHE`-based ciphers over `DHE`-based ciphers). The order is important because `ECDHE` suites are faster, you want to use them whenever clients supports them. Ephemeral `DHE/ECDHE` are recommended and support Perfect Forward Secrecy. `ECDHE-ECDSA` is about the same as `RSA` in performance, but much more secure. `ECDHE` with `RSA` is slower, but still much more secure than alone `RSA`.

  > For backward compatibility software components think about less restrictive ciphers. Not only that you have to enable at least one special `AES128` cipher for HTTP/2 support regarding to [RFC7540: TLS 1.2 Cipher Suites](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7540#section-9.2.2) <sup>[IETF]</sup>, you also have to allow `prime256` elliptic curves which reduces the score for key exchange by another 10% even if a secure server preferred order is set.

  > Servers either use the client's most preferable ciphersuite or their own. Most servers use their own preference. Disabling `DHE` removes forward security, but results in substantially faster handshake times. I think, so long as you only control one side of the conversation, it would be ridiculous to restrict your system to only supporting one cipher suite (it would cut off too many clients and too much traffic). On the other hand, look at what [David Benjamin](https://davidben.net/) (from Chrome networking) sad about it: _Servers should also disable `DHE` ciphers. Even if `ECDHE` is preferred, merely supporting a weak group leaves `DHE`-capable clients vulnerable._

  > Also modern cipher suites (e.g. from Mozilla recommendations) suffers from compatibility troubles mainly because drops `SHA-1` (see what Google said about it in 2014: [Gradually sunsetting SHA-1](https://security.googleblog.com/2014/09/gradually-sunsetting-sha-1.html)). But be careful if you want to use ciphers with `HMAC-SHA-1` - there's a perfectly good [explanation](https://crypto.stackexchange.com/a/26518) why.

  > If you want to get **A+ with 100%s on SSL Lab** (for Cipher Strength) you should definitely disable `128-bit` (that's the main reason why you should not use them) and `CBC` cipher suites which have had many weaknesses.

  > In my opinion `128-bit` symmetric encryption doesnâ€™t less secure. Moreover, there are about 30% faster and still secure. For example TLS 1.3 use `TLS_AES_128_GCM_SHA256 (0x1301)` (for TLS-compliant applications).

  > You should disable `CHACHA20_POLY1305` (e.g. `TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256` and `TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256`) to comply with HIPAA and NIST (however, Mozilla uses them, IETF also recommend to use these cipher suites) guidelines and `CBC` ciphersuites to comply with PCI DSS, HIPAA, and NIST guidelines.

  > Mozilla recommends leaving the default ciphers for TLSv1.3 and not explicitly enabling them in the configuration (TLSv1.3 doesn't require any particular changes). This is one of the changes: we need to know is that the cipher suites are fixed unless an application explicitly defines TLS 1.3 cipher suites. Thus, all of your TLSv1.3 connections will use `AES-256-GCM`, `ChaCha20`, then `AES-128-GCM`, in that order. I also recommend relying on OpenSSL because for TLS 1.3 the cipher suites are fixed so setting them will not affect (you will automatically use those three ciphers).

  > We currently don't have the ability to control TLS 1.3 cipher suites without support from the NGINX to use new API (that is why today, you cannot specify the TLSv1.3 cipher suites, applications still have to adapt). NGINX isn't able to influence that so at this moment all available ciphers are always on (also if you disable potentially weak cipher from NGINX). On the other hand the ciphers in TLSv1.3 have been restricted to only a handful of completely secure ciphers by leading crypto experts.

  > By default, OpenSSL 1.1.1* with TLSv1.3 disable `TLS_AES_128_CCM_SHA256` and `TLS_AES_128_CCM_8_SHA256` ciphers. In my opinion, `ChaCha20+Poly1305` or `AES/GCM` are very efficient in the most cases. On modern processors, the common `AES-GCM` cipher and mode are sped up by dedicated hardware, making that algorithm's implementation faster than anything by a wide margin. On older or cheaper processors that lack that feature, though, the `ChaCha20` cipher runs faster than `AES-GCM`, as was the `ChaCha20` designers' intention.

  > If you want to use `TLS_AES_128_CCM_SHA256` and `TLS_AES_128_CCM_8_SHA256` ciphers (for example on constrained systems which are usually constrained for everything) see [TLSv1.3 and `CCM` ciphers](doc/HELPERS.md#tlsv13-and-ccm-ciphers). But remember: `GCM` should be considered superior to `CCM` for most applications that require authenticated encryption.

  > For TLS 1.2 you should consider disable weak ciphers without forward secrecy like ciphers with `CBC` algorithm. Using them also reduces the final grade because they don't use ephemeral keys. In my opinion you should use ciphers with `AEAD` (TLS 1.3 supports only these suites) encryption because they don't have any known weaknesses.

  > Recently new vulnerabilities like Zombie POODLE, GOLDENDOODLE, 0-Length OpenSSL and Sleeping POODLE were published for websites that use `CBC` (Cipher Block Chaining) block cipher modes. These vulnerabilities are applicable only if the server uses TLS 1.2 or TLS 1.1 or TLS 1.0 with `CBC` cipher modes. Look at [Zombie POODLE, GOLDENDOODLE, & How TLSv1.3 Can Save Us All](https://i.blackhat.com/asia-19/Fri-March-29/bh-asia-Young-Zombie-Poodle-Goldendoodle-and-How-TLSv13-Can-Save-Us-All.pdf) presentation from Black Hat Asia 2019.

  > Disable TLS cipher modes that use RSA encryption (all ciphers that start with `TLS_RSA_WITH_*`) because they are really vulnerable to [ROBOT](https://robotattack.org/) attack. Not all servers that support `RSA` key exchange are vulnerable, but it is recommended to disable `RSA` key exchange ciphers as it does not support forward secrecy. TLS 1.3 doesnâ€™t use `RSA` key exchanges because theyâ€™re not forward secret.

  > You should also absolutely disable weak ciphers regardless of the TLS version do you use, like those with `DSS`, `DSA`, `DES/3DES`, `RC4`, `MD5`, `SHA1`, `null`, anon in the name.

  > We have a nice online tool for testing compatibility cipher suites with user agents: [CryptCheck](https://tls.imirhil.fr/suite). I think it will be very helpful for you.

  > If in doubt, use one of the recommended Mozilla kits (see below).

  At the end, some interesting statistics [Logjam: the latest TLS vulnerability explained](https://blog.cloudflare.com/logjam-the-latest-tls-vulnerability-explained/):

  > _94% of the TLS connections to CloudFlare customer sites uses `ECDHE` (more precisely 90% of them being `ECDHE-RSA-AES` of some sort and 10% `ECDHE-RSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305`) and provides Forward Secrecy. The rest use static `RSA` (5.5% with `AES`, 0.6% with `3DES`)._

  **My recommendation:**

  > Use only [TLSv1.3 and TLSv1.2](#keep-only-tls1.2-tls13) with below cipher suites (remember about min. `2048-bit` DH params for `DHE`!):
  ```nginx

#### :beginner: Use more secure ECDH Curve

###### Rationale

  > Keep an eye also on this: _Secure implementations of the standard curves are theoretically possible but very hard._

  > In my opinion your main source of knowledge should be [The SafeCurves web site](https://safecurves.cr.yp.to/). This site reports security assessments of various specific curves.

  > For a SSL server certificate, an "elliptic curve" certificate will be used only with digital signatures (`ECDSA` algorithm). NGINX provides directive to specifies a curve for `ECDHE` ciphers (`ssl_ecdh_curve`).

  > `x25519` is a more secure (also with SafeCurves requirements) but slightly less compatible option. I think to maximise interoperability with existing browsers and servers, stick to `P-256` (`prime256v1`) and `P-384` (`secp384r1`) curves. Of course there's tons of different opinions about them.

  > NSA Suite B says that NSA uses curves `P-256` and `P-384` (in OpenSSL, they are designated as, respectively, `prime256v1` and `secp384r1`). There is nothing wrong with `P-521`, except that it is, in practice, useless. Arguably, `P-384` is also useless, because the more efficient `P-256` curve already provides security that cannot be broken through accumulation of computing power.

  > Bernstein and Lange believe that the NIST curves are not optimal and there are better (more secure) curves that work just as fast, e.g. `x25519`.

  > The SafeCurves say:
  >   - `NIST P-224`, `NIST P-256` and `NIST P-384` are **UNSAFE**

  > From the curves described here only `x25519` is a curve meets all SafeCurves requirements.

  > I think you can use `P-256` to minimise trouble. If you feel that your manhood is threatened by using a 256-bit curve where a 384-bit curve is available, then use `P-384`: it will increases your computational and network costs.

  > If you use TLS 1.3 you should enable `prime256v1` signature algorithm. Without this SSL Lab reports `TLS_AES_128_GCM_SHA256 (0x1301)` signature as weak.

  > If you do not set `ssl_ecdh_curve`, then NGINX will use its default settings, e.g. Chrome will prefer `x25519`, but it is **not recommended** because you can not control default settings (seems to be `P-256`) from the NGINX.

  > Explicitly set `ssl_ecdh_curve X25519:prime256v1:secp521r1:secp384r1;` **decreases the Key Exchange SSL Labs rating**.

  > Definitely do not use the `secp112r1`, `secp112r2`, `secp128r1`, `secp128r2`, `secp160k1`, `secp160r1`, `secp160r2`, `secp192k1` curves. They have a too small size for security application according to NIST recommendation.

  **My recommendation:**

  > Use only [TLSv1.3 and TLSv1.2](#keep-only-tls1.2-tls13) and [only strong ciphers](#use-only-strong-ciphers) with the following curves:
  ```nginx
  ssl_ecdh_curve X25519:secp521r1:secp384r1:prime256v1;
  ```

###### Example

Curves for TLS 1.2:

```nginx
ssl_ecdh_curve secp521r1:secp384r1:prime256v1;
```

&nbsp;&nbsp;:arrow_right: ssllabs score: <b>100%</b>

```nginx
# Alternative (this one doesnâ€™t affect compatibility, by the way; itâ€™s just a question of the preferred order).

# This setup downgrade Key Exchange score but is recommended for TLS 1.2 + TLS 1.3:
ssl_ecdh_curve X25519:secp521r1:secp384r1:prime256v1;
```

#### :beginner: Use strong Key Exchange with Perfect Forward Secrecy

###### Rationale

  > To use a signature based authentication you need some kind of DH exchange (fixed or ephemeral/temporary), to exchange the session key. If you use it, NGINX will use the default Ephemeral Diffie-Hellman (`DHE`) paramaters to define how performs the Diffie-Hellman (DH) key-exchange. In older versions, NGINX used a weak key (by default: `1024 bit`) that gets lower scores.

  > You should always use the Elliptic Curve Diffie Hellman Ephemeral (`ECDHE`) and if you want to retain support for older customers also `DHE`. Due to increasing concern about pervasive surveillance, key exchanges that provide Forward Secrecy are recommended, see for example [RFC 7525 - 6.3. Forward Secrecy](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7525#section-6.3) <sup>[IETF]</sup>.

  > For greater compatibility but still for security in key exchange, you should prefer the latter E (ephemeral) over the former E (EC). There is recommended configuration: `ECDHE` > `DHE` (with unique keys at least 2048 bits long) > `ECDH`. With this if the initial handshake fails, another handshake will be initiated using `DHE`.

  > `DHE` is slower than `ECDHE`. If you are concerned about performance, prioritize `ECDHE-ECDSA` over `DHE`. OWASP estimates that the TLS handshake with `DHE` hinders the CPU by a factor of 2.4 compared to `ECDHE`.

  > Diffie-Hellman requires some set-up parameters to begin with. Parameters from `ssl_dhparam` (which are generated with `openssl dhparam ...`) define how OpenSSL performs the Diffie-Hellman (DH) key-exchange. They include a field prime `p` and a generator `g`. The purpose of the availability to customize these parameter is to allow everyone to use own parameters for this. This can be used to prevent being affected from the Logjam attack (both the client and the server need to be vulnerable in order for the attack to succeed because the server must accept to sign small `DHE_EXPORT` parameters, and the client must accept them as valid `DHE` parameters).

  > Modern clients prefer `ECDHE` instead other variants and if your NGINX accepts this preference then the handshake will not use the DH param at all since it will not do a `DHE` key exchange but an `ECDHE` key exchange. Thus, if no plain `DH/DHE` ciphers are configured at your server but only Eliptic curve DH (e.g. `ECDHE`) then you don't need to set your own `ssl_dhparam` directive. Enabling `DHE` requires us to take care of our DH primes (a.k.a. `dhparams`) and to trust in `DHE`.

  > Elliptic curve Diffie-Hellman is a modified Diffie-Hellman exchange which uses Elliptic curve cryptography instead of the traditional RSA-style large primes. So, while I'm not sure what parameters it may need (if any), I don't think it needs the kind you're generating (`ECDH` is based on curves, not primes, so I don't think the traditional DH params will do you any good).

  > Cipher suites using `DHE` key exchange in OpenSSL require `tmp_DH` parameters, which the `ssl_dhparam` directive provides. The same is true for `DH_anon` key exchange, but in practice nobody uses those. The OpenSSL wiki page for Diffie Hellman Parameters it says: _To use perfect forward secrecy cipher suites, you must set up Diffie-Hellman parameters (on the server side)._ Look also at [SSL_CTX_set_tmp_dh_callback](https://www.openssl.org/docs/man1.0.2/man3/SSL_CTX_set_tmp_dh.html).

  > If you use `ECDH/ECDHE` key exchange please see [Use more secure ECDH Curve](#beginner-use-more-secure-ecdh-curve) rule.

  > In older versions of OpenSSL, if no key size is specified, default key size was `512/1024 bits` - it was vulnerable and breakable. For the best security configuration use your own DH Group (min. `2048 bit`) or use known safe ones pre-defined DH groups (it's recommended; the pre-defined DH groups `ffdhe2048`, `ffdhe3072` or `ffdhe4096` recommended by the IETF in [RFC 7919](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7919#appendix-A) <sup>[IETF]</sup> are audited and may be more resistant to attacks than ones randomly generated) from Mozilla SSL Configuration Generator:
  >
  >  - [ffdhe2048](https://ssl-config.mozilla.org/ffdhe2048.txt)
  >  - [ffdhe4096](https://ssl-config.mozilla.org/ffdhe4096.txt)

  > The `2048 bit` is generally expected to be safe and is already very far into the "cannot break it zone". However, years ago people expected 1024 bit to be safe so if you are after long term resistance you would go up to `4096 bit` (for both RSA keys and DH parameters). It's also important if you want to get 100% on Key Exchange of the SSL Labs test.

  > You should remember that the `4096 bit` modulus will make DH computations slower and wonâ€™t actually improve security.

  There is [good explanation](https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/47204/dh-parameters-recommended-size/47207#47207) about DH parameters recommended size:

  > _Current recommendations from various bodies (including NIST) call for a `2048-bit` modulus for DH. Known DH-breaking algorithms would have a cost so ludicrously high that they could not be run to completion with known Earth-based technology. See this site for pointers on that subject._

  > _You don't want to overdo the size because the computational usage cost rises relatively sharply with prime size (somewhere between quadratic and cubic, depending on some implementation details) but a `2048-bit` DH ought to be fine (a basic low-end PC can do several hundreds of `2048-bit` DH per second)._

  Look also at this answer by [Matt Palmer](https://www.hezmatt.org/~mpalmer/blog/):

  > _Indeed, characterising `2048 bit` DH parameters as "weak as hell" is quite misleading. There are no known feasible cryptographic attacks against arbitrary strong 2048 bit DH groups. To protect against future disclosure of a session key due to breaking DH, sure, you want your DH parameters to be as long as is practical, but since `1024 bit` DH is only just getting feasible, `2048 bits` should be OK for most purposes for a while yet._

  Take a look at this interesting answer comes from [Guide to Deploying Diffie-Hellman for TLS](https://weakdh.org/sysadmin.html):

  > _2. Deploy (Ephemeral) Elliptic-Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDHE). Elliptic-Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) key exchange avoids all known feasible cryptanalytic attacks, and modern web browsers now prefer ECDHE over the original, finite field, Diffie-Hellman. The discrete log algorithms we used to attack standard Diffie-Hellman groups do not gain as strong of an advantage from precomputation, and individual servers do not need to generate unique elliptic curves._

  **My recommendation:**

  > If you use only TLS 1.3 - `ssl_dhparam` is not required (not used). Also, if you use `ECDHE/ECDH` - `ssl_dhparam` is not required (not used). If you use `DHE/DH` - `ssl_dhparam` with DH parameters is required (min. `2048 bit`). By default no parameters are set, and therefore `DHE` ciphers will not be used.

###### Example

To set DH params:

```nginx
# curl https://ssl-config.mozilla.org/ffdhe2048.txt --output ffdhe2048.pem
ssl_dhparam ffdhe2048.pem;
```

To generate DH params:

```bash
# To generate a DH parameters:

# To produce "DSA-like" DH parameters:

# Use the pre-defined DH groups:

#### :beginner: Prevent Replay Attacks on Zero Round-Trip Time

###### Rationale

  > This rules is only important for TLS 1.3. By default enabling TLS 1.3 will not enable 0-RTT support. After all, you should be fully aware of all the potential exposure factors and related risks with the use of this option.

  > 0-RTT Handshakes is part of the replacement of TLS Session Resumption and was inspired by the QUIC Protocol.

  > 0-RTT creates a significant security risk. With 0-RTT, a threat actor can intercept an encrypted client message and resend it to the server, tricking the server into improperly extending trust to the threat actor and thus potentially granting the threat actor access to sensitive data.

  > On the other hand, including 0-RTT (Zero Round Trip Time Resumption) results in a significant increase in efficiency and connection times. TLS 1.3 has a faster handshake that completes in 1-RTT. Additionally, it has a particular session resumption mode where, under certain conditions, it is possible to send data to the server on the first flight (0-RTT).

  > For example, Cloudflare only supports 0-RTT for [GET requests with no query parameters](https://new.blog.cloudflare.com/introducing-0-rtt/) in an attempt to limit the attack surface. Moreover, in order to improve identify connection resumption attempts, they relay this information to the origin by adding an extra header to 0-RTT requests. This header uniquely identifies the request, so if one gets repeated, the origin will know it's a replay attack (the application needs to track values received from that and reject duplicates on non-idempotent endpoints).

  > To protect against such attacks at the application layer, the `$ssl_early_data` variable should be used. You'll also need to ensure that the `Early-Data` header is passed to your application. `$ssl_early_data` returns 1 if TLS 1.3 early data is used and the handshake is not complete.

  > However, as part of the upgrade, you should disable 0-RTT until you can audit your application for this class of vulnerability.

  > In order to send early-data, client and server [must support PSK exchange mode](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8446#section-2.3) <sup>[IETF]</sup> (session cookies).

  > In addition, I would like to recommend [this](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=16667036) great discussion about TLS 1.3 and 0-RTT.

  If you are unsure to enable 0-RTT, look what Cloudflare say about it:

  > _Generally speaking, 0-RTT is safe for most web sites and applications. If your web application does strange things and youâ€™re concerned about its replay safety, consider not using 0-RTT until you can be certain that there are no negative effects. [...] TLS 1.3 is a big step forward for web performance and security. By combining TLS 1.3 with 0-RTT, the performance gains are even more dramatic._

###### Example

Test 0-RTT with OpenSSL:

```bash
# 1)
_host="example.com"

cat > req.in << __EOF__
HEAD / HTTP/1.1
Host: $_host
Connection: close
__EOF__
# or:
# echo -e "GET / HTTP/1.1\r\nHost: $_host\r\nConnection: close\r\n\r\n" > req.in

openssl s_client -connect ${_host}:443 -tls1_3 -sess_out session.pem -ign_eof < req.in
openssl s_client -connect ${_host}:443 -tls1_3 -sess_in session.pem -early_data req.in

# 2)
python -m sslyze --early_data "$_host"
```

Enable 0-RTT with `$ssl_early_data` variable:

```nginx
server {

  ...

  ssl_protocols   TLSv1.2 TLSv1.3;
  # To enable 0-RTT (TLS 1.3):
  ssl_early_data  on;

  location / {

    proxy_pass       http://backend_x20;
    # It protect against such attacks at the application layer:
    proxy_set_header Early-Data $ssl_early_data;

  }

  ...

}
```

#### :beginner: Defend against the BEAST attack

###### Rationale

  > Generally the BEAST attack relies on a weakness in the way `CBC` mode is used in SSL/TLS.

  > More specifically, to successfully perform the BEAST attack, there are some conditions which needs to be met:
  >
  >   - vulnerable version of SSL must be used using a block cipher (`CBC` in particular)
  >   - JavaScript or a Java applet injection - should be in the same origin of the web site
  >   - data sniffing of the network connection must be possible

  > To prevent possible use BEAST attacks you should enable server-side protection, which causes the server ciphers should be preferred over the client ciphers, and completely excluded TLS 1.0 from your protocol stack.

```nginx
ssl_prefer_server_ciphers on;
```

#### :beginner: Mitigation of CRIME/BREACH attacks

###### Rationale

  > Disable HTTP compression or compress only zero sensitive content. Furthermore, you shouldn't use HTTP compression on private responses when using TLS.

  > By default, the `gzip` compression modules are installed but not enabled in the NGINX.

  > You should probably never use TLS compression. Some user agents (at least Chrome) will disable it anyways. Disabling SSL/TLS compression stops the attack very effectively (libraries like OpenSSL built with compression disabled using `no-comp` configuration option). A deployment of HTTP/2 over TLS 1.2 must disable TLS compression (please see [RFC 7540 - 9.2. Use of TLS Features](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7540#section-9.2) <sup>[IETF]</sup>).

  > CRIME exploits SSL/TLS compression which is disabled since NGINX 1.3.2. BREACH exploits only HTTP compression.

  > Some attacks are possible (e.g. the real BREACH attack is a complicated and this only applies if specific information is returned in the HTTP responses) because of gzip (HTTP compression not TLS compression) being enabled on SSL requests.

  > Compression is not the only requirement for the attack to be done so using it does not mean that the attack will succeed. Generally you should consider whether having an accidental performance drop on HTTPS sites is better than HTTPS sites being accidentally vulnerable.

  > In most cases, the best action is to simply disable gzip for SSL but some of resources explain that is not a decent option to solving this. Mitigation is mostly on an application level, however common mitigation is to add data of random length to any responses containing sensitive data (it's default behaviour of TLSv1.3 - [5.4.  Record Padding](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-tls-tls13-21#section-5.4) <sup>[IETF]</sup>). For more information look at [nginx-length-hiding-filter-module](https://github.com/nulab/nginx-length-hiding-filter-module). This filter module provides functionality to append randomly generated HTML comment to the end of response body to hide correct response length and make it difficult for attackers to guess secure token.

  > I would gonna to prioritise security over performance but compression can be (I think) okay to HTTP compress publicly available static content like css or js and HTML content with zero sensitive info (like an "About Us" page).

###### Example

```nginx
# Disable dynamic HTTP compression:
gzip off;

# Enable dynamic HTTP compression for specific location context:
location ^~ /assets/ {

  gzip on;

  ...

}
```

#### :beginner: Enable HTTP Strict Transport Security

###### Rationale

  > Generally HSTS is a way for websites to tell browsers that the connection should only ever be encrypted. This prevents MITM attacks, downgrade attacks, sending plain text cookies and session ids.

  > The header indicates for how long a browser should unconditionally refuse to take part in unsecured HTTP connection for a specific domain.

  > When a browser knows that a domain has enabled HSTS, it does two things:
  >
  > - always uses an `https://` connection, even when clicking on an `http://` link or after typing a domain into the location bar without specifying a protocol
  > - removes the ability for users to click through warnings about invalid certificates

  > The HSTS header needs to be set inside the HTTP block with the `ssl` listen statement or you risk sending Strict-Transport-Security headers over HTTP sites you may also have configured on the server. Additionally, you should use `return 301` for the HTTP server block to be redirected to HTTPS.

  > Ideally, you should always use `includeSubdomains` with HSTS. This will provide robust security for the main hostname as well as all subdomains. The issue here is that (without `includeSubdomains`) a man in the middle attacker can create arbitrary subdomains and use them inject cookies into your application. In some cases, even leakage might occur. The drawback of `includeSubdomains`, of course, is that you will have to deploy all subdomains over SSL.

  > There are a few simple best practices for HSTS (from [The Importance of a Proper HTTP Strict Transport Security Implementation on Your Web Server](https://blog.qualys.com/securitylabs/2016/03/28/the-importance-of-a-proper-http-strict-transport-security-implementation-on-your-web-server)):
  >
  > - The strongest protection is to ensure that all requested resources use only TLS with a well-formed HSTS header. Qualys recommends providing an HSTS header on all HTTPS resources in the target domain
  >
  > - It is advisable to assign the `max-age` directiveâ€™s value to be greater than `10368000` seconds (120 days) and ideally to `31536000` (one year). Websites should aim to ramp up the `max-age` value to ensure heightened security for a long duration for the current domain and/or subdomains
  >
  > - [RFC 6797 14.4. The Need for includeSubDomains](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6797) <sup>[IETF]</sup>, advocates that a web application must aim to add the `includeSubDomain` directive in the policy definition whenever possible. The directiveâ€™s presence ensures the HSTS policy is applied to the domain of the issuing host and all of its subdomains, e.g. `example.com` and `www.example.com`
  >
  > - The application should never send an HSTS header over a plaintext HTTP header, as doing so makes the connection vulnerable to SSL stripping attacks
  >
  > - It is not recommended to provide an HSTS policy via the `http-equiv` attribute of a meta tag. According to [RFC 6797](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6797) <sup>[IETF]</sup>, user agents donâ€™t heed `http-equiv="Strict-Transport-Security"` attribute on `<meta>` elements on the received content`

  > To meet the [HSTS preload list](https://hstspreload.org/) standard a root domain needs to return a `strict-transport-security` header that includes both the `includeSubDomains` and `preload` directives and has a minimum `max-age` of one year. Your site must also serve a valid SSL certificate on the root domain and all subdomains, as well as redirect all HTTP requests to HTTPS on the same host.

  > You had better be pretty sure that your website is indeed all HTTPS before you turn this on because HSTS adds complexity to your rollback strategy. Google recommend enabling HSTS this way:
  >
  >   1) Roll out your HTTPS pages without HSTS first
  >   2) Start sending HSTS headers with a short `max-age`. Monitor your traffic both from users and other clients, and also dependents' performance, such as ads
  >   3) Slowly increase the HSTS `max-age`
  >   4) If HSTS doesn't affect your users and search engines negatively, you can, if you wish, ask your site to be added to the HSTS preload list used by most major browsers

  **My recommendation:**

  > Set the `max-age` to a big value like `31536000` (12 months) or `63072000` (24 months) with `includeSubdomains` parameter.

###### Example

```nginx
add_header Strict-Transport-Security "max-age=63072000; includeSubdomains" always;
```

#### :beginner: Reduce XSS risks (Content-Security-Policy)

###### Rationale

  > CSP reduce the risk and impact a wide range of attacks, including cross-site scripting and other cross-site injections in modern browsers. Is a good defence-in-depth measure to make exploitation of an accidental lapse in that less likely.

  > The inclusion of CSP policies significantly impedes successful XSS attacks, UI Redressing (Clickjacking), malicious use of frames or CSS injections.

  > Whitelisting known-good resource origins, refusing to execute potentially dangerous inline scripts, and banning the use of eval are all effective mechanisms for mitigating cross-site scripting attacks.

  > The default policy that starts building a header is: block everything. By modifying the CSP value, the programmer loosens restrictions for specific groups of resources (e.g. separately for scripts, images, etc.).

  > You should approach very individually and never set CSP sample values found on the Internet or anywhere else. Blindly deploying "standard/recommend" versions of the CSP header will broke the most of web apps.

  > Before enabling this header, you should discuss about CSP parameters with developers and application architects. They probably going to have to update web application to remove any inline scripts and styles, and make some additional modifications there.

  > Strict policies will significantly increase security, and higher code quality will reduce the overall number of errors. CSP can never replace secure code - new restrictions help reduce the effects of attacks (such as XSS), but they are not mechanisms to prevent them!

  > You should always validate CSP before implement:
  >
  > - [CSP Evaluator](https://csp-evaluator.withgoogle.com/)
  > - [Content Security Policy (CSP) Validator](https://cspvalidator.org/)

  > For generate a policy (remember, however, that these types of tools may become outdated or have errors):

  > - [https://report-uri.com/home/generate](https://report-uri.com/home/generate)

###### Example

```nginx
# This policy allows images, scripts, AJAX, and CSS from the same origin, and does not allow any other resources to load:
add_header Content-Security-Policy "default-src 'none'; script-src 'self'; connect-src 'self'; img-src 'self'; style-src 'self';" always;

#### :beginner: Control the behaviour of the Referer header (Referrer-Policy)

###### Rationale

  > Referral policy deals with what information (related to the url) the browser ships to a server to retrieve an external resource.

  > Basically this is a privacy enhancement, when you want to hide information for owner of the domain of a link where is clicked that the user came from your website.

  > I think the most secure value is `no-referrer` which specifies that no referrer information is to be sent along with requests made from a particular request client to any origin. The header will be omitted entirely.

  > The use of `no-referrer` has its advantages because it allows you to hide the HTTP header, and this increases online privacy and the security of users themselves. On the other hand, it can mainly affects analytics (in theory, should not have any SEO impact) because `no-referrer` specifies to hide that kind of information.

  > Mozilla has a good table explaining how each of referrer policy options works. It comes from [Mozilla's reference documentation about Referer Policy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Referrer-Policy).

###### Example

```nginx
# This policy does not send information about the referring site after clicking the link:
add_header Referrer-Policy "no-referrer";
```

#### :beginner: Provide clickjacking protection (X-Frame-Options)

###### Rationale

  > Helps to protect your visitors against clickjacking attacks by declaring a policy whether your application may be embedded on other (external) pages using frames.

  > It is recommended that you use the `x-frame-options` header on pages which should not be allowed to render a page in a frame.

  > This header allows 3 parameters, but in my opinion you should consider only two: a `deny` parameter to disallow embedding the resource in general or a `sameorigin` parameter to allow embedding the resource on the same host/origin.

  > It has a lower priority than CSP but in my opinion it is worth using as a fallback.

###### Example

```nginx
# Only pages from the same domain can "frame" this URL:
add_header X-Frame-Options "SAMEORIGIN" always;
```

#### :beginner: Prevent some categories of XSS attacks (X-XSS-Protection)

###### Rationale

  > Enable the cross-site scripting (XSS) filter built into modern web browsers.

  >  It's usually enabled by default anyway, so the role of this header is to re-enable the filter for this particular website if it was disabled by the user.

  > I think you can set this header without consulting its value with web application architects but all well written apps have to emit header `X-XSS-Protection: 0` and just forget about this feature. If you want to have extra security that better user agents can provide, use a strict `Content-Security-Policy` header. There is an [exact answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/57802070) by [Mikko Rantalainen](https://stackoverflow.com/users/334451/mikko-rantalainen).

#### :beginner: Prevent Sniff Mimetype middleware (X-Content-Type-Options)

###### Rationale

  > It prevents the browser from doing MIME-type sniffing.

  > Setting this header will prevent the browser from interpreting files as something else than declared by the content type in the HTTP headers.

# Disallow content sniffing:

#### :beginner: Deny the use of browser features (Feature-Policy)

###### Rationale

  > This header protects your site from third parties using APIs that have security and privacy implications, and also from your own team adding outdated APIs or poorly optimised images.

###### Example

```nginx
add_header Feature-Policy "geolocation 'none'; midi 'none'; notifications 'none'; push 'none'; sync-xhr 'none'; microphone 'none'; camera 'none'; magnetometer 'none'; gyroscope 'none'; speaker 'none'; vibrate 'none'; fullscreen 'none'; payment 'none'; usb 'none';";

#### :beginner: Reject unsafe HTTP methods

###### Rationale

  > An ordinary web server supports the `GET`, `HEAD` and `POST` methods to retrieve static and dynamic content. Other (e.g. `OPTIONS`, `TRACE`) methods should not be supported on public web servers, as they increase the attack surface.

  > However, some of the APIs (e.g. RESTful APIs) uses also other methods. In addition to the following protection, application architects should also verify incoming requests and methods.

###### Example

```nginx
add_header Allow "GET, HEAD, POST" always;

if ($request_method !~ ^(GET|HEAD|POST)$) {

  return 405;

}
```

#### :beginner: Prevent caching of sensitive data

###### Rationale

  > This policy should be implemented by the application architect, however, I know from experience that this does not always happen.

  > Don' to cache or persist sensitive data. As browsers have different default behaviour for caching HTTPS content, pages containing sensitive information should include a `Cache-Control` header to ensure that the contents are not cached.

  > One option is to add anticaching headers to relevant HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2 responses, e.g. `Cache-Control: no-cache, no-store` and `Expires: 0`.

  > To cover various browser implementations the full set of headers to prevent content being cached should be:
  >
  > 1 - `Cache-Control: no-cache, no-store, private, must-revalidate, max-age=0, no-transform`<br>
  > 2 - `Pragma: no-cache`<br>
  > 3 - `Expires: 0`

###### Example

```nginx
location /api {

  expires 0;
  add_header Cache-Control "no-cache, no-store";

}
```

#### :beginner: Control Buffer Overflow attacks

###### Rationale

  > Buffer overflow attacks are made possible by writing data to a buffer and exceeding that buffersâ€™ boundary and overwriting memory fragments of a process. To prevent this in NGINX we can set buffer size limitations for all clients.

  > Corresponding values depends on your server memory and how many traffic you have. Long ago I found an interesting formula:
  >
  > &nbsp;&nbsp;`MAX_MEMORY = client_body_buffer_size x CONCURRENT_TRAFFIC - OS_RAM - FS_CACHE`
  >
  > I think the key is to monitor all the things (MEMORY/CPU/Traffic) and change settings according your usage, star little of course then increase until you can.

  > In my opinion, using a smaller `client_body_buffer_size` (a little bigger than 10k but not so much) is definitely better, since a bigger buffer could ease DoS attack vectors, since you would allocate more memory for it.

  > Tip: If a request body is larger than `client_body_buffer_size`, it's written to disk and not available in memory, hence no `$request_body`. Additionally, setting the `client_body_buffer_size` to high may affect the log file size (if you log `$request_body`).

###### Example

```nginx
client_body_buffer_size       16k;    # default: 8k (32-bit) | 16k (64-bit)
client_header_buffer_size     1k;     # default: 1k
client_max_body_size          100k;   # default: 1m
large_client_header_buffers   2 1k;   # default: 4 8k
```

#### :beginner: Mitigating Slow HTTP DoS attacks (Closing Slow Connections)

###### Rationale

  > You can close connections that are writing data too infrequently, which can represent an attempt to keep connections open as long as possible (thus reducing the serverâ€™s ability to accept new connections).

  > In my opinion, 2-3 seconds for `keepalive_timeout` are often enough for most folks to parse HTML/CSS and retrieve needed images, icons, or frames, connections are cheap in NGINX so increasing this is generally safe. However, setting this too high will result in the waste of resources (mainly memory) as the connection will remain open even if there is no traffic, potentially: significantly affecting performance. I think this should be as close to your average response time as possible.

  > I would also suggest that if you set the `send_timeout` small then your web server will close connections quickly which will give more overall connections available to connecting hosts.

  > These parameters are most likely only relevant in a high traffic webserver. Both are supporting the same goal and that is less connections and more efficient handling of requests. Either putting all requests into one connection (keep alive) or closing connections quickly to handle more requests (send timeout).

###### Example

```nginx
client_body_timeout           10s;    # default: 60s
client_header_timeout         10s;    # default: 60s
keepalive_timeout             5s 5s;  # default: 75s
send_timeout                  10s;    # 6default: 0s
```

#### :beginner: Use pass directive compatible with backend protocol

###### Rationale

  > All `proxy_*` directives are related to the backends that use the specific backend protocol.

  > You should always use `proxy_pass` only for HTTP servers working on the backend layer (set also the `http://` protocol before referencing the HTTP backend) and other `*_pass` directives only for non-HTTP backend servers (like a uWSGI or FastCGI).

  > Directives such as `uwsgi_pass`, `fastcgi_pass`, or `scgi_pass` are designed specifically for non-HTTP apps and you should use them instead of the `proxy_pass` (non-HTTP talking).

  > For example: `uwsgi_pass` uses an uwsgi protocol. `proxy_pass` uses normal HTTP to talking with uWSGI server. uWSGI docs claims that uwsgi protocol is better, faster and can benefit from all of uWSGI special features. You can send to uWSGI information what type of data you are sending and what uWSGI plugin should be invoked to generate response. With http (`proxy_pass`) you won't get that.

###### Example

Not recommended configuration:

```nginx
server {

  location /app/ {

    # For this, you should use uwsgi_pass directive.
    proxy_pass      192.168.154.102:4000;         # backend layer: uWSGI Python app.

  }

  ...

}
```

Recommended configuration:

```nginx
server {

  location /app/ {

    proxy_pass      http://192.168.154.102:80;    # backend layer: OpenResty as a front for app.

  }

  location /app/v3 {

    uwsgi_pass      192.168.154.102:8080;         # backend layer: uWSGI Python app.

  }

  location /app/v4 {

    fastcgi_pass    192.168.154.102:8081;         # backend layer: php-fpm app.

  }
  ...

}
```

#### :beginner: Be careful with trailing slashes in `proxy_pass` directive

###### Rationale

  > NGINX replaces part literally and you could end up with some strange url.

  > If `proxy_pass` used without URI (i.e. without path after `server:port`) NGINX will put URI from original request exactly as it was with all double slashes, `../` and so on.

  > URI in `proxy_pass` acts like alias directive, means NGINX will replace part that matches location prefix with URI in `proxy_pass` directive (which I intentionally made the same as location prefix) so URI will be the same as requested but normalized (without doule slashes and all that staff).

###### Example

```nginx
location = /a {

  proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8080/a;

#### :beginner: Set and pass `Host` header only with `$host` variable

###### Rationale

  > You should almost always use `$host` as a incoming host variable, because it's the only one guaranteed to have something sensible regardless of how the user-agent behaves, unless you specifically need the semantics of one of the other variables.

  > Itâ€™s always a good idea to modify the `Host` header to make sure that the virtual host resolution on the downstream server works as it should.

  > `$host` is simply `$http_host` with some processing (stripping port number and lowercasing) and a default value (of the `server_name`), so there's no less "exposure" to the `Host` header sent by the client when using `$http_host`. There's no danger in this though.

  > The variable `$host` is the host name from the request line or the http header. The variable `$server_name` is the name of the server block we are in right now.

  > The difference is explained in the NGINX documentation:
  >
  >   - `$host` contains in this order of precedence: host name from the request line, or host name from the `Host` request header field, or the server name matching a request
  >   - `$http_host` contains the content of the HTTP `Host` header field, if it was present in the request (equals always the `HTTP_HOST` request header)
  >   - `$server_name` contains the `server_name` of the virtual host which processed the request, as it was defined in the NGINX configuration. If a server contains multiple server names, only the first one will be present in this variable

  > `$http_host`, moreover, is better than `$host:$server_port` because it uses the port as present in the URL, unlike `$server_port` which uses the port that NGINX listens on.

```nginx
proxy_set_header    Host    $host;

#### :beginner: Set properly values of the `X-Forwarded-For` header

###### Rationale

  > In the light of the latest httpoxy vulnerabilities, there is really a need for a full example, how to use `HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR` properly. In short, the load balancer sets the 'most recent' part of the header. In my opinion, for security reasons, the proxy servers must be specified by the administrator manually.

  > `X-Forwarded-For` is the custom HTTP header that carries along the original IP address of a client so the app at the other end knows what it is. Otherwise it would only see the proxy IP address, and that makes some apps angry.

  > The `X-Forwarded-For` depends on the proxy server, which should actually pass the IP address of the client connecting to it. Where a connection passes through a chain of proxy servers, `X-Forwarded-For` can give a comma-separated list of IP addresses with the first being the furthest downstream (that is, the user). Because of this, servers behind proxy servers need to know which of them are trustworthy.

  > The proxy used can set this header to anything it wants to, and therefore you can't trust its value. Most proxies do set the correct value though. This header is mostly used by caching proxies, and in those cases you're in control of the proxy and can thus verify that is gives you the correct information. In all other cases its value should be considered untrustworthy.

  > Some systems also use `X-Forwarded-For` to enforce access control. A good number of applications rely on knowing the actual IP address of a client to help prevent fraud and enable access.

  > Value of the `X-Forwarded-For` header field can be set at the client's side - this can also be termed as `X-Forwarded-For` spoofing. However, when the web request is made via a proxy server, the proxy server modifies the `X-Forwarded-For` field by appending the IP address of the client (user). This will result in 2 comma separated IP addresses in the `X-Forwarded-For` field.

  > A reverse proxy is not source IP address transparent. This is a pain when you need the client source IP address to be correct in the logs of the backend servers. I think the best solution of this problem is configure the load balancer to add/modify an `X-Forwarded-For` header with the source IP of the client and forward it to the backend in the correct form.

  > Unfortunately, on the proxy side we are not able to solve this problem (all solutions can be spoofable), it is important that this header is correctly interpreted by application servers. Doing so ensures that the apps or downstream services have accurate information on which to make their decisions, including those regarding access and authorization.

  There is also an interesing idea what to do in this situation:

  > _To prevent this we must distrust that header by default and follow the IP address breadcrumbs backwards from our server. First we need to make sure the `REMOTE_ADDR` is someone we trust to have appended a proper value to the end of `X-Forwarded-For`. If so then we need to make sure we trust the `X-Forwarded-For` IP to have appended the proper IP before it, so on and so forth. Until, finally we get to an IP we donâ€™t trust and at that point we have to assume thatâ€™s the IP of our user._ - it comes from [Proxies & IP Spoofing](https://xyu.io/2013/07/04/proxies-ip-spoofing/) by [Xiao Yu](https://github.com/xyu).

###### Example

```nginx
# The whole purpose that it exists is to do the appending behavior:
proxy_set_header    X-Forwarded-For    $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
# Above is equivalent for this:
proxy_set_header    X-Forwarded-For    $http_x_forwarded_for,$remote_addr;
# The following is also equivalent for above but in this example we use http_realip_module:
proxy_set_header    X-Forwarded-For    "$http_x_forwarded_for, $realip_remote_addr";
```

- [Forwarded header](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Forwarded)

#### :beginner: Don't use `X-Forwarded-Proto` with `$scheme` behind reverse proxy

###### Rationale

  > `X-Forwarded-Proto` can be set by the reverse proxy to tell the app whether it is HTTPS or HTTP or even an invalid name.

  > The scheme (i.e. HTTP, HTTPS) variable evaluated only on demand (used only for the current request).

  > Setting the `$scheme` variable will cause distortions if it uses more than one proxy along the way. For example: if the client go to the `https://example.com`, the proxy stores the scheme value as HTTPS. If the communication between the proxy and the next-level proxy takes place over HTTP, then the backend sees the scheme as HTTP. So if you set `$scheme` for `X-Forwarded-Proto` on the next-level proxy, app will see a different value than the one the client came with.

  > For resolve this problem you can also use [this](HELPERS.md#set-correct-scheme-passed-in-x-forwarded-proto) configuration snippet.

###### Example

```nginx
# 1) client <-> proxy <-> backend
proxy_set_header    X-Forwarded-Proto  $scheme;

# 2) client <-> proxy <-> proxy <-> backend
# proxy_set_header  X-Forwarded-Proto  https;
proxy_set_header    X-Forwarded-Proto  $proxy_x_forwarded_proto;
```

###### External resources

- [Reverse Proxy - Passing headers (from this handbook)](NGINX_BASICS.md#passing-headers)

#### :beginner: Always pass `Host`, `X-Real-IP`, and `X-Forwarded` headers to the backend

###### Rationale

  > When using NGINX as a reverse proxy you may want to pass through some information of the remote client to your backend web server. I think it's good practices because gives you more control of forwarded headers.

  > It's very important for servers behind proxy because it allow to interpret the client correctly. Proxies are the "eyes" of such servers, they should not allow a curved perception of reality. If not all requests are passed through a proxy, as a result, requests received directly from clients may contain e.g. inaccurate IP addresses in headers.

  > `X-Forwarded` headers are also important for statistics or filtering. Other example could be access control rules on your app, because without these headers filtering mechanism may not working properly.

  > If you use a front-end service like Apache or whatever else as the front-end to your APIs, you will need these headers to understand what IP or hostname was used to connect to the API.

  > Forwarding these headers is also important if you use the HTTPS protocol (it has become a standard nowadays).

  > However, I would not rely on either the presence of all `X-Forwarded` headers, or the validity of their data.

###### Example

```nginx
location / {

  proxy_pass          http://bk_upstream_01;

  # The following headers also should pass to the backend:
  #   - Host - host name from the request line, or host name from the Host request header field, or the server name matching a request
  # proxy_set_header  Host               $host:$server_port;
  # proxy_set_header  Host               $http_host;
  proxy_set_header    Host               $host;

  #   - X-Real-IP - forwards the real visitor remote IP address to the proxied server
  proxy_set_header    X-Real-IP          $remote_addr;

  # X-Forwarded headers stack:
  #   - X-Forwarded-For - mark origin IP of client connecting to server through proxy
  # proxy_set_header  X-Forwarded-For    $remote_addr;
  # proxy_set_header  X-Forwarded-For    $http_x_forwarded_for,$remote_addr;
  # proxy_set_header  X-Forwarded-For    "$http_x_forwarded_for, $realip_remote_addr";
  proxy_set_header    X-Forwarded-For    $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;

  #   - X-Forwarded-Host - mark origin host of client connecting to server through proxy
  # proxy_set_header  X-Forwarded-Host   $host:443;
  proxy_set_header    X-Forwarded-Host   $host:$server_port;

  #   - X-Forwarded-Server - the hostname of the proxy server
  proxy_set_header    X-Forwarded-Server $host;

  #   - X-Forwarded-Port - defines the original port requested by the client
  # proxy_set_header  X-Forwarded-Port   443;
  proxy_set_header    X-Forwarded-Port   $server_port;

  #   - X-Forwarded-Proto - mark protocol of client connecting to server through proxy
  # proxy_set_header  X-Forwarded-Proto  https;
  # proxy_set_header  X-Forwarded-Proto  $proxy_x_forwarded_proto;
  proxy_set_header    X-Forwarded-Proto  $scheme;

}

#### :beginner: Use custom headers without `X-` prefix

###### Rationale

  > The use of custom headers with `X-` prefix is not forbidden but discouraged. In other words, you can keep using `X-` prefixed headers, but it's not recommended and you may not document them as if they are public standard.

  > Internet Engineering Task Force released in [RFC-6648](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6648) <sup>[IETF]</sup> recommended deprecation of `X-` prefix.

  > The `X-` in front of a header name customarily has denoted it as experimental/non-standard/vendor-specific. Once it's a standard part of HTTP, it'll lose the prefix.

  > If itâ€™s possible for new custom header to be standardized, use a non-used and meaningful header name.

###### Example

Not recommended configuration:

```nginx
add_header X-Backend-Server $hostname;
```

Recommended configuration:

```nginx
add_header Backend-Server   $hostname;
```

- [Set the HTTP headers with add_header and proxy_*_header directives properly (from this handbook)](#beginner-set-the-http-headers-with-add_header-and-proxy__header-directives-properly)

#### :beginner: Always use `$request_uri` instead of `$uri` in `proxy_pass`

###### Rationale

  > Naturally, there are exceptions to what I'm going to say about this. I think the best rule for pass unchanged URI to the backend layer is use `proxy_pass http://<backend>` without any arguments.

  > If you add something more at the end of `proxy_pass` directive, you should always pass unchanged URI to the backend layer unless you know what you're doing. For example, using `$uri` accidentally in `proxy_pass` directives opens you up to http header injection vulnerabilities because URL encoded characters are decoded (this sometimes matters and is not equivalent to `$request_uri`). And what's more, the value of `$uri` may change during request processing, e.g. when doing internal redirects, or when using index files.

  > The `request_uri` is equal to the original request URI as received from the client including the arguments. In this case (pass variable like a `$request_uri`), if URI is specified in the directive, it is passed to the server as is, replacing the original request URI.

  > Note also that using `proxy_pass` with variables implies various other side effects, notably use of resolver for dynamic name resolution, and generally less effective than using names in a configuration.

  Look also what the NGINX documentation say about it:

  > _If proxy_pass is specified without a URI, the request URI is passed to the server in the same form as sent by a client when the original request is processed [...]_

###### Example

Not recommended configuration:

```nginx
location /foo {

  proxy_pass http://django_app_server$uri;

}
```

Recommended configuration:

```nginx
location /foo {

  proxy_pass http://django_app_server$request_uri;

}
```

Most recommended configuration:

```nginx
location /foo {

  proxy_pass http://django_app_server;

}
```

- **[Others](#others)**

#### :beginner: Tweak passive health checks

###### Rationale

  > Monitoring for health is important on all types of load balancing mainly for business continuity. Passive checks watches for failed or timed-out connections as they pass through NGINX as requested by a client.

  > This functionality is enabled by default but the parameters mentioned here allow you to tweak their behaviour. Default values are: `max_fails=1` and `fail_timeout=10s`.

###### Example

```nginx
upstream backend {

  server bk01_node:80 max_fails=3 fail_timeout=5s;
  server bk02_node:80 max_fails=3 fail_timeout=5s;

}
```

###### External resources

- [Module ngx_http_upstream_module](https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_upstream_module.html)

#### :beginner: Don't disable backends by comments, use `down` parameter

###### Rationale

  > Sometimes we need to turn off backends e.g. at maintenance-time. I think good solution is marks the server as permanently unavailable with `down` parameter even if the downtime takes a short time.

  > It's also important if you use IP Hash load balancing technique. If one of the servers needs to be temporarily removed, it should be marked with this parameter in order to preserve the current hashing of client IP addresses.

  > Comments are good for really permanently disable servers or if you want to leave information for historical purposes.

  > NGINX also provides a `backup` parameter which marks the server as a backup server. It will be passed requests when the primary servers are unavailable. I use this option rarely for the above purposes and only if I am sure that the backends will work at the maintenance time.

  > You can also use `ngx_dynamic_upstream` for operating upstreams dynamically with HTTP APIs.

###### Example

```nginx
upstream backend {

  server bk01_node:80 max_fails=3 fail_timeout=5s down;
  server bk02_node:80 max_fails=3 fail_timeout=5s;

}
```

#### :beginner: Enable DNS CAA Policy

###### Rationale

  > DNS CAA policy helps you to control which Certificat Authorities are allowed to issue certificates for your domain becaues if no CAA record is present, any CA is allowed to issue a certificate for the domain.

  > The purpose of the CAA record is to allow domain owners to declare which certificate authorities are allowed to issue a certificate for a domain. They also provide a means of indicating notification rules in case someone requests a certificate from an unauthorized certificate authority.

  > If no CAA record is present, any CA is allowed to issue a certificate for the domain. If a CAA record is present, only the CAs listed in the record(s) are allowed to issue certificates for that hostname.

###### Example

Generic configuration (Google Cloud DNS, Route 53, OVH, and other hosted services) for Let's Encrypt:

```bash
example.com. CAA 0 issue "letsencrypt.org"
```

#### :beginner: Define security policies with `security.txt`

###### Rationale

  > The main purpose of `security.txt` is to help make things easier for companies and security researchers when trying to secure platforms. It also provides information to assist in disclosing security vulnerabilities.

  > When security researchers detect potential vulnerabilities in a page or application, they will try to contact someone "appropriate" to "responsibly" reveal the problem. It's worth taking care of getting to the right address.

  > This file should be placed under the `/.well-known/` path, e.g. `/.well-known/security.txt` ([RFC5785](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5785) <sup>[IETF]</sup>) of a domain name or IP address for web properties.

#### :beginner: Use tcpdump to diagnose and troubleshoot the HTTP issues

###### Rationale

  > Tcpdump is a swiss army knife (is a well known command line packet analyzer/protocol decoding) for all the administrators and developers when it comes to troubleshooting. You can use it to monitor HTTP traffic between a proxy (or clients) and your backends.

  > I use tcpdump for a quick inspection. If I need a more in-depth inspection I capture everything to a file and open it with powerfull sniffer which can decode lots of protocols, lots of filters like a wireshark.

  > Run `man tcpdump | less -Ip examples` to see some examples.

###### Example

Capture everything and write to a file:

```bash
tcpdump -X -s0 -w dump.pcap <tcpdump_params>
```

Monitor incoming (on interface) traffic, filter by `<ip:port>`:

```bash
tcpdump -ne -i eth0 -Q in host 192.168.252.1 and port 443
```

  * `-n` - don't convert addresses (`-nn` will not resolve hostnames or ports)
  * `-e` - print the link-level headers
  * `-i [iface|any]` - set interface
  * `-Q|-D [in|out|inout]` - choose send/receive direction (`-D` - for old tcpdump versions)
  * `host [ip|hostname]` - set host, also `[host not]`
  * `[and|or]` - set logic
  * `port [1-65535]` - set port number, also `[port not]`

Monitor incoming (on interface) traffic, filter by `<ip:port>` and write to a file:

```bash
tcpdump -ne -i eth0 -Q in host 192.168.252.10 and port 80 -c 5 -w dump.pcap
```

  * `-c [num]` - capture only num number of packets
  * `-w [filename]` - write packets to file, `-r [filename]` - reading from file

Monitor all HTTP GET traffic/requests:

```bash
tcpdump -i eth0 -s 0 -A -vv 'tcp[((tcp[12:1] & 0xf0) >> 2):4] = 0x47455420'
```

  * `tcp[((tcp[12:1] & 0xf0) >> 2):4]` - first determines the location of the bytes we are interested in (after the TCP header) and then selects the 4 bytes we wish to match against
  * `0x47455420` - represents the ASCII value of characters 'G', 'E', 'T', ' '

Monitor all HTTP POST traffic/requests, filter by destination port:

```bash
tcpdump -i eth0 -s 0 -A -vv 'tcp dst port 80 and (tcp[((tcp[12:1] & 0xf0) >> 2):4] = 0x504f5354)'
```

  * `0x504F5354` - represents the ASCII value of characters 'P', 'O', 'S', 'T', ' '

Monitor HTTP traffic including request and response headers and message body, filter by port:

```bash
tcpdump -A -s 0 'tcp port 80 and (((ip[2:2] - ((ip[0]&0xf)<<2)) - ((tcp[12]&0xf0)>>2)) != 0)'
```

Monitor HTTP traffic including request and response headers and message body, filter by `<src-ip:port>`:

```bash
tcpdump -A -s 0 'src 192.168.252.10 and tcp port 80 and (((ip[2:2] - ((ip[0]&0xf)<<2)) - ((tcp[12]&0xf0)>>2)) != 0)'
```
